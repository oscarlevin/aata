      <title>What's Not Constructible</title>
      
      <introduction permid="jwc">
        <p permid="PDl">
          We are are now ready to solve the questions of antiquity about geometric constructions.  Briefly, here is what we know already.
        </p>
        
        <p permid="vKu">
          The constructible numbers are a field containing <m>\Q</m> and contained in <m>\R</m>.  The field is closed under taking square roots of positive elements.  Right away, this tells us that numbers like <m>\sqrt{\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{7}}}</m> are constructible.
        </p>
        
        <p permid="bRD">
          We also know something about the converse: if a real number <m>\alpha</m> is constructible, then it exists in a field extension <m>F_k</m> which is <q>at the end</q> of a sequence of iterated extensions
          <me permid="Aun">
            {\mathbb Q} = F_0 \subset F_1 \subset \cdots \subset F_k
          </me>
          such that <m>F_i = F_{i-1}( \sqrt{ \alpha_i}\, )</m> with
          <m>\alpha_i \in F_i</m>.  In other words, the <em>only</em> way to get a constructible number is to find it inside a field extension you get by repeatedly adjoining square roots of elements in the previous field.
        </p>

        <p permid="HYM">
          In particular, now that we know something about the degree of a field extension, we know that <m>[F_i:F_{i-1}] = 2</m> in each of the iterated extensions, and by the <em>tower rule</em> ( <xref ref="theorem-tower-indices"/>) we know that if <m>\alpha</m> is constructible, then there exists an integer <m>k \gt 0</m> such that <m>[{\mathbb Q}(\alpha) : {\mathbb Q} ] = 2^k</m>.          
        </p>
        
        <p permid="ofV">
          So how does this help prove that you cannot construct particular geometric figures?  We will argue that if it were possible to construct such a figure, then a particular number would be constructible.  To show that is impossible, we will argue about the degree of the field extension that contains that number.

                This is impossible since <m>\pi</m> and consequently
                <m>\sqrt{\pi}</m> are both transcendental.
                Therefore, using a straightedge and compass,
                it is not possible to construct a square with the same area as the circle.

              The question is whether given <em>any</em> angle, it is possible to construct the angle which is one third of it.  To prove this is impossible, we need only show that some angle is non-constructible while three times it is constructible.

              We will show that it is impossible to construct a <m>20^\circ</m> angle.
              Consequently, a <m>60^{\circ}</m> angle cannot be trisected.
              We first need to calculate the triple-angle formula for the cosine:
              <md permid="tUK">
                <mrow>\cos 3 \theta &amp; = \cos( 2 \theta + \theta )</mrow>

                <mrow>&amp; = ( 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1) \cos \theta - 2 \sin^2 \theta \cos \theta</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = ( 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1) \cos \theta - 2 (1- \cos^2 \theta) \cos \theta</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta</mrow>
              </md>.
              The angle <m>\theta</m> can be constructed if and only if <m>\alpha = \cos \theta</m> is constructible.
              Let <m>\theta = 20^{\circ}</m>.
              Then <m>\cos 3 \theta = \cos 60^\circ = 1/2</m>.
              By the triple-angle formula for the cosine,
              <me permid="NNB">
                4 \alpha^3 - 3 \alpha = \frac{1}{2}
              </me>.
              Therefore, <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>8 x^3 - 6 x -1</m>.
              This polynomial has no factors in <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>,
              and hence is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>.
              Thus, <m>[{\mathbb Q}( \alpha ) : {\mathbb Q }] = 3</m>.
              Consequently, <m>\alpha</m> cannot be a constructible number.

              Algebraic number theory uses the tools of algebra to solve problems in number theory.
              Modern algebraic number theory began with Pierre de Fermat
                  <idx><h>Fermat, Pierre de</h></idx>
              (1601<ndash/>1665).
              Certainly we can find many positive integers that satisfy the equation
              <m>x^2 + y^2 = z^2</m>; Fermat conjectured that the equation
              <m>x^n + y^n = z^n</m> has no positive integer solutions for <m>n \geq 3</m>.
              He stated in the margin of his copy of the Latin translation of Diophantus' <pubtitle>Arithmetica</pubtitle> that he had found a marvelous proof of this theorem,
              but that the margin of the book was too narrow to contain it.
              Building on work of other mathematicians,
              it was Andrew Wiles who finally succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem in the 1990s.
              Wiles's achievement was reported on the front page of the <pubtitle>New York Times</pubtitle>.

              Attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem have led to important contributions to algebraic number theory by such notable mathematicians as Leonhard Euler
                  <idx><h>Euler, Leonhard</h></idx>
              (1707<ndash/>1783).
              Significant advances in the understanding of Fermat's Last Theorem were made by Ernst Kummer
                  <idx><h>Kummer, Ernst</h></idx>
              (1810<ndash/>1893).
              Kummer's student, Leopold Kronecker
                  <idx><h>Kronecker, Leopold</h></idx>
              (1823<ndash/>1891), became one of the leading algebraists of the nineteenth century.
              Kronecker's theory of ideals and his study of algebraic number theory added much to the understanding of fields.

              Göttingen was truly one the most important centers of mathematical research during the last two centuries.

              and Weyl.

              answered questions in number theory using algebraic geometry,
              a field of mathematics that studies geometry by studying commutative rings.
              From about 1955 to 1970, Alexander Grothendieck
                  <idx><h>Grothendieck, Alexander</h></idx>
              dominated the field of algebraic geometry.

              a student of Grothendieck,

              proof of the Mordell-Weil conjecture.

              This conjecture of Mordell and Weil essentially says that certain polynomials <m>p(x, y)</m> in
