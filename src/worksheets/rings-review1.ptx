    <title>Activity: Review of Rings and Quotient Rings</title>

    <introduction permid="uFO">
      
        <p permid="jbq">
          The goal of this activity is to remind ourselves of basic but crucially important definitions we will need in our study of fields.
        </p>
        
        <p permid="Piz">
          You will be asked to provide definitions. Some definitions will include terms that also should be defined.  Make sure that everyone knows what every word in a definition means (if not, provide definitions for those words).  For example, a <term>field</term> is a commutative division ring.  If you have not yet defined commutative ring and division ring, you should say what these mean.

              An <term>integral domain</term> is a commutative ring with unity which contains no zero-divisors.  That is, there is no non-zero element <m>a</m> such that <m>a \cdot b = 0</m> for some non-zero <m>b</m>.  Equivalently, we could say that an integral domain is a commutative ring with unity which satisfies the cancelation property: that if <m>a \ne 0</m> and <m>ab = ac</m> then <m>b = c</m>.

              An ideal is a type of subring (which is a subset that is also a ring).  While a ring must be closed under addition, subtraction (i.e., additive inverses), and multiplication, and <em>ideal</em> must also have the property that the product of an element inside the ideal with any element of the ring (even outside the idea) will be an element in the idea.  That is, <m>ra \in I</m> whenever <m>r \in R</m> and <m>a \in I</m>, the ideal.
