    <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the polynomial <m>a(x) = x^4 - 2</m> in <m>\Q[x]</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the splitting field <m>E</m> for <m>a(x)</m> over <m>\Q</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are four roots of <m>a(x)</m>, namely <m>\pm \sqrt[4]{2}</m> and <m>\pm\sqrt[4]{2}i</m>.

        <p> 
          Describe the Galois group <m>G</m> for <m>a(x)</m> over <m>\Q</m>.  How big is it?  Does it look like any group we have studied before?
