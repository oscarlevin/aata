    <title>Activity: Extending Fields to Factor</title>

    <introduction permid="BOB">
      
        <p permid="xOC">Goal: Build the smallest field possible in which <m>p(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 2</m> is NOT irreducible.</p>
        
        <p permid="dVL">
          Note that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>\Q</m> because it has no roots in <m>\Q</m> (why is this and why is that enough?).  So let's invent a new number, call it <m>\s</m>, and insist that <m>\s</m> is a root of <m>p(x)</m>.  Then consider the smallest field <m>E</m> larger than <m>\Q</m> that also contains <m>\s</m>.

That nothing else is is a consequence of the previous question: since <m>\s^3</m> can already be expressed as a linear combination of <m>1</m>, <m>\s</m>, and <m>\s^2</m>, any power of <m>\s</m> greater or equal to 3 can be as well.

              Yes, we get <m>p(x) = (x-\s)(x^2 + (3+\s)x - 1 + 3\s + \s^2)</m>.  Do this by long division.  The remainder might not look like zero right away, except that it is precisely <m>p(\s)</m>.  This is not a surprise: the division algorithm says that <m>p(x) = b(x)(x-\s) + r(x)</m> where <m>r(x)</m> is either the zero polynomial or has degree 0 (less than the degree of <m>(x-\s)</m>).  Now plug in <m>\s</m> for <m>x</m>.  Long division is just there to help us find <m>b(x)</m>.

              This is a hard question that we will return to.  Note that all we must check still is that every non-zero element in <m>E</m> has a multiplicative inverse.  That is, given <m>a+b\s + c\s^2</m>, find an element <m>a' + b'\s + c'\s^2</m> such that

                (a+b\s+c \s^2)(a' + b'\s + c'\s^2) = 1
              </me>.
              You could do this algebraically, although it is not an easy computation, and requires you to know that the polynomial <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible.  We will see why later.

              The element <m>x^3+\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is an element of <m>\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>, but it can also be written as a <q>simpler</q> coset.  How?

              Since <m>x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 2 \in \langle p(x) \rangle</m> we see that <m>x^3 + \langle p(x) \rangle = -3x^2 + x - 2 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.  You can get here either by dividing <m>x^3</m> by <m>p(x)</m> and looking for the remainder, or by asking, what would I need to add to <m>p(x)</m> to get <m>x^3</m>.  
              That is because the coset <m>x^3 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> contains all the polynomials in <m>\Q[x]</m> that result from adding <m>x^3</m> to a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>.  One of these elements is <m>x^3</m> (since the polynomial <m>0</m> is a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>).  
              So if we can find another polynomial <m>a(x)</m> such that <m>a(x)</m> added to a multiple of <m>p(x)</m> gives <m>x^3</m>, then <m>a(x) + \langle p(x)\rangle</m> will be exactly the same coset as <m>x^3 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.

                This looks very much like the definition of <m>E</m>, and in fact it suggests that <m>E \cong \Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.  This is correct, as we could prove using the fundamental homomorphism theorem.  To do that, we would need to identify a surjective homomorphism from <m>\Q[x]</m> onto <m>E</m> for which <m>p(x)</m> was the kernel.
