    <title>Activity: Extending Fields to Factor</title>

    <introduction>
      
        <p>Goal: Build the smallest field possible in which <m>p(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 2</m> is NOT irreducible.</p>
        
        <p>
          Note that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>\Q</m> because it has no roots in <m>\Q</m> (why is this and why is that enough?).  So let's invent a new number, call it <m>\s</m>, and insist that <m>\s</m> is a root of <m>p(x)</m>.  Then consider the smallest field <m>E</m> larger than <m>\Q</m> that also contains <m>\s</m>.
        </p>

            <p> 
              List five elements in <m>E</m> that are NOT already in 
              <m>\Q</m>.  
            </p>
           </statement>
           <solution>
             <p>
               For example, <m>\s</m> (which is not in <m>\Q</m> because, by the rational roots theorem, there are no roots to <m>p(x)</m> in <m>\Q</m>), as well as <m>\s+1</m>, <m>4\s</m>, <m>\s^2</m>, and <m>3+\frac{1}{2}\s - \s^2</m>.

              The element <m>\s^3</m> is in <m>E</m>, but this can also be written using smaller powers of <m>\s</m>.  How?  
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since <m>\s^3 + 3\s^2 - \s + 2 = 0</m> we see that <m>\s^3 = -3\s^2 + \s - 2</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Describe <m>E</m> as a set using set builder notation.  In other words, <m>E</m> is the set of all elements of the form 
              <ellipsis />
            </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                <m>E = \{a + b \s + c \s^2 \st a, b, c, \in \Q\}</m>.  Certainly everything of this form is in <m>E</m> since <m>E</m> must be closed under addition and multiplication.  That nothing else is is a consequence of the previous question: since <m>\s^3</m> can already be expressed as a linear combination of <m>1</m>, <m>\s</m>, and <m>\s^2</m>, any power of <m>\s</m> greater or equal to 3 can be as well.

              Wait: why are we doing this?  Our goal is for <m>p(x)</m> to factor.  Does it?  What would one of the factors be?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <!-- <hint>
            <p>
              Is <m>x - \s</m> a factor?
            </p>
          </hint> -->
          <solution>
            <p>
              Yes, we get <m>p(x) = (x-\s)(x^2 + (3+\s)x - 1 + 3\s + \s^2)</m>.  Do this by long division.  The remainder might not look like zero right away, except that it is precisely <m>p(\s)</m>.  This is not a surprise: the division algorithm says that <m>p(x) = b(x)(x-\s) + r(x)</m> where <m>r(x)</m> is either the zero polynomial or has degree 0 (less than the degree of <m>(x-\s)</m>).  Now plug in <m>\s</m> for <m>x</m>.  Long division is just there to help us find <m>b(x)</m>.
            </p>

        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Wait again: we want <m>E</m> to be a field.  Is it?  What would we need to check?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              This is a hard question that we will return to.  Note that all we must check still is that every non-zero element in <m>E</m> has a multiplicative inverse.  That is, given <m>a+b\s + c\s^2</m>, find an element <m>a' + b'\s + c'\s^2</m> such that 
              <me>
                (a+b\s+c \s^2)(a' + b'\s + c'\s^2) = 1
              </me>.
              You could do this algebraically, although it is not an easy computation, and requires you to know that the polynomial <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible.  We will see why later.

            <p> 
              List five elements in the quotient ring <m>\Q[x]/\langle p(x)\rangle</m> (using the same <m>p(x)</m> from the previous page).  Remember, these will all be cosets.
            </p>
           </statement>
           <solution>
             <p>
               For example, <m>x  + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>,  <m>x+1 +\langle p(x) \rangle</m>, <m>4x + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>, <m>x^2 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>, and <m>3+\frac{1}{2}x - x^2 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.

            <p>
              The element <m>x^3+\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is an element of <m>\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>, but it can also be written as a <q>simpler</q> coset.  How?  
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since <m>x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 2 \in \langle p(x) \rangle</m> we see that <m>x^3 + \langle p(x) \rangle = -3x^2 + x - 2 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.  You can get here either by dividing <m>x^3</m> by <m>p(x)</m> and looking for the remainder, or by asking, what would I need to add to <m>p(x)</m> to get <m>x^3</m>.  
              That is because the coset <m>x^3 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> contains all the polynomials in <m>\Q[x]</m> that result from adding <m>x^3</m> to a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>.  One of these elements is <m>x^3</m> (since the polynomial <m>0</m> is a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>).  
              So if we can find another polynomial <m>a(x)</m> such that <m>a(x)</m> added to a multiple of <m>p(x)</m> gives <m>x^3</m>, then <m>a(x) + \langle p(x)\rangle</m> will be exactly the same coset as <m>x^3 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.

              Describe <m>\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> as a set using set builder notation.  In other words, this quotient ring is the set of all cosets of the form <ellipsis />
            </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                <m>\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle = \{a + bx + cx^2 + \langle p(x) \rangle \st a, b, c\in \Q\}</m>.  While we can certainly add a polynomial of degree greater to 2 to get a coset, we can always divide it by <m>p(x)</m> and get a remainder of degree 2 or less.  
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This looks very much like the definition of <m>E</m>, and in fact it suggests that <m>E \cong \Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.  This is correct, as we could prove using the fundamental homomorphism theorem.  To do that, we would need to identify a surjective homomorphism from <m>\Q[x]</m> onto <m>E</m> for which <m>p(x)</m> was the kernel.

              Wait: if we want to show that <m>E</m> is a field, and <m>E</m> is basically the same as <m>\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>, then we could just show <m>\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.  What would this mean?  What do we need to verify?

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              We need to verify that for any coset <m>a+bx + cx^2 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>, there is a coset <m>a' + b'x + c'x^2 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> such that the product of the two cosets is the multiplicative identity coset, namely <m>1 + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.  We will see how to do this next.
