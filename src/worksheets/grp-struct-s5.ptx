    <title>Activity: Working with <m>S_5</m></title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        To produce a degree 5 polynomial that is not solvable by radicals, it is enough to produce a polynomial that has <m>S_5</m> as its Galois group.  This raises two questions: First, how do you know that <m>S_5</m> really is the Galois group? Second, why is <m>S_5</m> the group we are looking for?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Let's start with the first question.  We claim that if the Galois group contains a 2-cycle and a 5-cycle, then the Galois group must contain all of <m>S_5</m>.  This comes down to the question of what elements <em>generate</em> <m>S_5</m>.

    <exercise workspace="15%">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Does <m>S_5</m> contain a non-trivial subgroup that contains all the transpositions (2-cycles)?  Explain.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          No.  As soon as you have all the transpositions, you have all of <m>S_5</m>, since every element can be written as a product of transpositions.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>


    <exercise workspace="15%">
        <statement>
        <p> 
          Does <m>S_5</m> contain a non-trivial subgroup that contains the set <m>\{(12), (13), (14), (15)\}</m>?  Explain.  Hint: what is <m>(12)(14)(12)</m>>
        </p>
       </statement>
       <solution>
         <p>
           No, because as soon as you have this set, you can get every transposition.  To get <m>(ab)</m> you can multiply <m>(1a)(1b)(1a)</m>.
         </p>

    <exercise workspace="15%">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Does <m>S_5</m> contain a non-trivial subgroup that contains <m>\{(24), (12345)\}</m>?  Explain.  
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Such a subgroup will have <m>(13524)</m>, <m>(14253)</m>, and <m>(15432)</m>, as these are the powers of <m>(12345)</m>
          Consider <m>(15432)(24)(12345) = (13)</m>. Can we get <m>(12)</m>?  Well, <m>(14253)(24)(12345) = (12)</m>.  We can get <m>(13524)(24)(14253) = (14)</m>.  Finally, we would show that we can also get <m>(15)</m>.  Then from the previous task, we get everything.

          Conclude that <m>S_5</m> can be generated by any 2-cycle and any 5-cycle.

          The previous task shows generalizes:

    <p>
      For the second main question, we must show that <m>A_5</m> is simple, because then the only normal series we can get for <m>S_5</m> will be 
      <me>
        S_5 \supset A_5 \supset \{(1)\}
      </me>
      but <m>A_5</m> is not abelian, so <m>S_5</m> is not solvable.

    <exercise workspace="25%">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>A_5</m> is generated by the set of 3-cycles.  You can do this by showing that every pair of transpositions can be written as a product of 3-cycles.

          Show that if a normal subgroup <m>N</m> of <m>A_5</m> contains even one 3-cycle, then it is all of <m>A_5</m>.  Remember, normal subgroups are closed under conjugates (here the conjugate would be <m>aba\inv</m> where <m>a \in A_5</m> and <m>b \in N</m>).
