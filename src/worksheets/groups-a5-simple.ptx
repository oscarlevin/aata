    <title>Activity: Working with <m>S_5</m> (part 1)</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        To prove that there is a degree 5 polynomial that is not solvable by radicals, we need to understand how <m>S_5</m> works.  Today will will prove that <m>S_5</m> is not a <em>solvable</em> group.  
      </p>
      
    <p>
      To do this, we can show that <m>A_5</m> is simple, because then the only normal series we can get for <m>S_5</m> will be 
      <me>
        S_5 \supset A_5 \supset \{(1)\}
      </me>
      but <m>A_5</m> is not abelian, so <m>S_5</m> is not solvable.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>A_5</m> is generated by the set of 3-cycles.  You can do this by showing that every pair of transpositions can be written as a product of 3-cycles.

          Show that if a normal subgroup <m>N</m> of <m>A_5</m> contains even one 3-cycle, then it is all of <m>A_5</m>.  Remember, normal subgroups are closed under conjugates (here the conjugate would be <m>aba\inv</m> where <m>a \in A_5</m> and <m>b \in N</m>).

          Finally, show that every non-trivial normal subgroup of <m>A_n</m> contains a 3-cycle.
