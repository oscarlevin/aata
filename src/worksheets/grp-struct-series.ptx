    <title>Activity: (Sub)Normal Series</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Given a group, we can look at subgroups.  We say that a sequence of subgroups
        <me>G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{e\}</me>
        is a <term>subnormal series</term> provided each <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1}</m>, and a <term>normal series</term> if each <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A non-trivial group <m>G</m> is called <term>simple</term> provided it has no non-trivial normal subgroups.  We say that a subnormal series is a <term>composition series</term> and that a normal series is a <term>principle series</term> if every quotient group <m>H_{i+1}/H_i</m> is simple.
