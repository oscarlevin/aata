    <title>Activity: Orders of Permutations</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
          The <em>order</em> of an element <m>g</m> in a group <m>G</m> is the least natural number <m>n</m> such that <m>g^n = e</m>, if such a number exists (otherwise we say the order of <m>g</m> is infinite). 
        </p>
    </introduction>


    <exercise workspace="15%">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the orders of the elements of <m>S_5</m> below:
          <me>\alpha = (12) \hspace{1in}\alpha = (123) \hspace{1in} \alpha = (1234) \hspace{1in} \alpha = (12345)</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The orders are 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>


        <exercise workspace="10%">
            <statement>
            <p> 
               Find an element of <m>S_5</m> that has an order different from those found above.  
            </p>
           </statement>
           <solution>
            <p>
              We will need an element that is not just a cycle, since the longest cycle is of length 5.  So how about <m>(12)(345)</m>.  This will have order 6.
            </p>
           </solution>
        </exercise>
        

        
        <exercise workspace="10%">
          <statement>
            <p>
            Let <m>\alpha</m> be an element of <m>S_5</m>.  What is <m>\alpha^{120}</m>?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              No matter what element we pick, <m>\alpha^{120}</m> will always be <m>(1)</m>.  This will work in general, but you can also see this by considering the orders of elements, which must all divide the size of the group.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </exercise>
        

    
    <exercise workspace="10%">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Is there an element in <m>S_5</m> that has order <m>120</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          No there is not.  If there were, this would say that <m>S_5</m> was cyclic, and would thus be abelian, which we know is not the case.  Alternatively, just look at how to write elements as disjoint cycles.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>
    
    <exercise workspace="1%">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What is the largest order of any element in <m>S_5</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The largest order will be 6, for elements that are the disjoint product of a 2-cycle and 3-cycle.  
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>
