          Recall that a <em>basis</em> for a vector space is a linearly independent spanning set, and that the <em>dimension</em> of a vector space is the size of a (any) basis for the space.  
        </p>
        <p permid="UXy">
          If <m>K</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m>, we can view <m>K</m> as a vector space over the field of scalars <m>F</m>.  In this case, we say the <term>degree</term> of <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>, written <m>[K:F]</m> is the dimension of this vector space.

          The polynomial <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion.  Therefore, it is the minimal polynomial for any of its roots, including <m>\alpha</m>.

              What is the connection between the degree of a field extension and polynomials?  Investigate this.  In particular, if you claim that you can always find a basis in some systematic way, how do you know it is really a basis?  How do you know the basis is linearly independent?  How do you know it spans?

              We claim that <m>[\Q(c):\Q]</m> is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial for <m>c</m> (so the degree of the extension is the degree of the polynomial).  In fact, we know that <m>\{1, c, c^2, \ldots, c^{n-1}\}</m> will always be a basis (where <m>n</m> is the degree).

            <p permid="wuO">
              Why is this?  We know that <m>\Q(c)</m> must contain all powers of <m>c</m>.  However, <m>c^m</m> for <m>m\ge n</m> can always be expressed as a linear combination of <m>c^i</m> for <m>i \lt n</m>, using the minimal polynomial for <m>c</m>.  This proves that <m>\{1, c, c^2, \ldots, c^{n-1}\}</m> spans <m>\Q(c)</m>.  To see why this set is linearly independent, note that if it were not, then there would be a linear combination of powers of <m>c</m> that was zero.  But that would give a polynomial equal to zero at <m>c</m>, making <m>c</m> a root of a polynomial of degree less than <m>n</m>.

              The polynomial <m>q(x) = x^7-6 x^6-7 x^5+51 x^4-60 x^2-21</m> has <m>\alpha</m> (from question 3) and <m>\sqrt{7}</m> as roots.  Does this mean <m>[\Q(\sqrt{7}):\Q] = [\Q(\alpha):\Q] = 7</m>?  Why not?

              Clearly this cannot be true, since we already said that these degrees were <m>2</m> and <m>5</m> respectively.  They key thing that made our argument work above was that the polynomial was a <em>minimal</em> polynomial.

              To further see that this is silly, what would the basis for <m>\Q(\sqrt{7})</m> be if it had size 7?  Would it be <m>\{1, \sqrt{7}, \sqrt{7}^2,\ldots, \sqrt{7}^6\}</m>?  That is clearly linearly dependent, since <m>\sqrt{7}^2</m> is a multiple of 1.
