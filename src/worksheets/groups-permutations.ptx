      <statement>
        <p permid="rSm">
          Can every permutation in <m>S_n</m> be represented using cycle notation?  How could you represent the permutation <m>\begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \amp 7 \amp 8 \amp 9 \\ 3 \amp 5 \amp 2 \amp 8 \amp 7 \amp 9 \amp 6 \amp 1 \amp 4  \end{pmatrix}</m>?

            <p permid="XZv"> 
               How should we define <q>cycle</q>?  Write a definition.  Some considerations: is <m>(132)(45)</m> a single cycle or two cycles?  Is <m>(3124)</m> a cycle?  What should we call the <term>length</term> of a cycle?

            <p permid="aUb">
              We will agree that <m>(132)(45)</m> is the product of two cycles, one of length 3, the other of length 2.  So the length of a cycle is the number of elements in it.

              Here are a few permutations of <m>S_7</m>, written as products of cycles.  Are there other ways to write each of these using cycle notation?  What makes two products of cycles the <em>same</em>?

            <p permid="Hbk">
              In fact, all four of these represent the same permutation.  You can see this my multiplying each out, which will always result in a product of disjoint cycles (or just a single cycle).  As long as we start with the smallest number of each cycle, the product of disjoint cycles is unique.

          A <em>transposition</em> (or <m>2</m>-cycle) is a cycle of <em>length</em> 2.  That is, it swaps (transposes) a pair of elements.

          Can the cycle <m>(13254)</m> be written as the product of transpositions?  Can it be written as the product of transpositions in more than one way?

      <solution permid="Wki">
        <p permid="nit">
          Yes, we could write this as <m>(14)(15)(12)(13)</m> or <m>(13)(23)(25)(45)</m> (do you see the way these were found?) but also in other less standard ways.  For one thing, we could always just add a pair of identical transpositions back to back (this is like multiplying by the identity): <m>(14)(15)(12)(13)(34)(34)</m>.

        <p permid="TpC">
          We could first multiply this out to get <m>(1235)</m> and then find <m>(15)(13)(12)</m> or <m>(12)(23)(35)</m>.  If we use a similar approach on each cycle separately we would get <m>(14)(12)(24)(25)(23)</m> or <m>(12)(24)(23)(35)(54)</m>.

          Can you write <m>(13)(24)(45)(15)(26)(13)</m> as the product of more than 6 transpositions?  Fewer than 6 transpositions?  Can you write it as the product of an odd number of transpositions?

      </statement>
      <solution permid="iyA">
        <p permid="zwL">
          We can multiply it out first: <m>(26453)</m> and then get <m>(26)(46)(45)(35)</m>.  Or we could just tack on some extra pairs: <m>(13)(24)(45)(16)(16)(26)(26)(15)(26)(13)</m>.  However it certainly seems like we will always need to use an even number of transpositions.

          What numbers of transpositions can you write the identity <m>(1)</m> as?

      <solution permid="OFJ">
        <p permid="fDU">
          Note that <m>(1)</m> is not written as any transpositions, so we might even say that this is 0 transpositions.  We could write <m>(12)(12)</m> or <m>(13)(24)(13)(24)</m> (here since the transpositions are disjoint, they commute).  It looks like the identity must be written as an even number of transpositions.
