    <title>Activity: Writing Cycles and Permutations</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
          Goal: Understand how elements of <m>S_n</m> can be represented as cycles and products of cycles.

    <exercise workspace="20%">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Can every permutation in <m>S_n</m> be represented using cycle notation?  How could you represent the permutation <m>\begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \amp 7 \amp 8 \amp 9 \\ 3 \amp 5 \amp 2 \amp 8 \amp 7 \amp 9 \amp 6 \amp 1 \amp 4  \end{pmatrix}</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This particular permutation would be written as <m>(132576948)</m>.

            <p> 
               How should we define <q>cycle</q>?  Write a definition.  Some considerations: is <m>(132)(45)</m> a single cycle or two cycles?  Is <m>(3124)</m> a cycle?  What should we call the <term>length</term> of a cycle?
            </p>
           </statement>
           <solution>
            <p>
              We will agree that <m>(132)(45)</m> is the product of two cycles, one of length 3, the other of length 2.  So the length of a cycle is the number of elements in it.

            <p>
              Here are a few permutations of <m>S_7</m>, written as products of cycles.  Are there other ways to write each of these using cycle notation?  What makes two products of cycles the <em>same</em>?
              <me>
                (142)(2534)(46)(135) \qquad\quad (12546) \qquad\quad (16)(14)(15)(12) \qquad\quad (12)(37)(25)(37)(45)(46)
              </me>
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              In fact, all four of these represent the same permutation.  You can see this my multiplying each out, which will always result in a product of disjoint cycles (or just a single cycle).  As long as we start with the smallest number of each cycle, the product of disjoint cycles is unique.

        <p>
          A <em>transposition</em> (or <m>2</m>-cycle) is a cycle of <em>length</em> 2.  That is, it swaps (transposes) a pair of elements.
        </p>

    
    <exercise workspace="20%">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Can the cycle <m>(13254)</m> be written as the product of transpositions?  Can it be written as the product of transpositions in more than one way?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Yes, we could write this as <m>(14)(15)(12)(13)</m> or <m>(13)(23)(25)(45)</m> (do you see the way these were found?) but also in other less standard ways.  For one thing, we could always just add a pair of identical transpositions back to back (this is like multiplying by the identity): <m>(14)(15)(12)(13)(34)(34)</m>.

          What about the product <m>(124)(2354)</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We could first multiply this out to get <m>(1235)</m> and then find <m>(15)(13)(12)</m> or <m>(12)(23)(35)</m>.  If we use a similar approach on each cycle separately we would get <m>(14)(12)(24)(25)(23)</m> or <m>(12)(24)(23)(35)(54)</m>.

        <p>
          Can you write <m>(13)(24)(45)(15)(26)(13)</m> as the product of more than 6 transpositions?  Fewer than 6 transpositions?  Can you write it as the product of an odd number of transpositions?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can multiply it out first: <m>(26453)</m> and then get <m>(26)(46)(45)(35)</m>.  Or we could just tack on some extra pairs: <m>(13)(24)(45)(16)(16)(26)(26)(15)(26)(13)</m>.  However it certainly seems like we will always need to use an even number of transpositions.

    <exercise workspace="1%">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What numbers of transpositions can you write the identity <m>(1)</m> as? 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Note that <m>(1)</m> is not written as any transpositions, so we might even say that this is 0 transpositions.  We could write <m>(12)(12)</m> or <m>(13)(24)(13)(24)</m> (here since the transpositions are disjoint, they commute).  It looks like the identity must be written as an even number of transpositions.
