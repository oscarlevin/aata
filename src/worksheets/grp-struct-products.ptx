    <title>Activity: Decomposing with Direct Products</title>

    <introduction permid="BVS">
        <p permid="Ztj">
          Recall that last semester we saw that <m>\Z_6 \cong \Z_2\times \Z_3</m>.  When does this sort of thing happen?

    </introduction>

    <exercise workspace="30%" permid="idb">
      <statement>
        <p permid="FAs">
          Given positive integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>, is it always true that <m>\Z_{mn} \cong \Z_m\times \Z_n</m>?   If this is not always true, for which <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> is it true?  Try some (many) examples. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="zbm">
        <p permid="PZx">
          This is not always true.  For example, <m>\Z_4 \not\cong \Z_2 \times \Z_2</m>.  Similarly, <m>\Z_12 \not\cong \Z_2 \times \Z_6</m>.  In both of these cases, we know the groups are not isomorphic because <m>Z_{mn}</m> is cyclic, but the direct product is not.  What we need to have happen is that one of the elements of <m>\Z_m\times \Z_n</m> has order <m>mn</m>, and this will not happen if <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> have a common factor larger than 1. 
        </p>
        
        <p permid="wgG">
          It is not obvious that this condition is also sufficient.  It is, as we will soon prove.

        <statement>
        <p permid="lHB"> 
          Consider <m>\Z_{12}</m>.  Can we break this down as the direct product of two smaller <m>\Z_p</m> groups?  In other words is <m>\Z_{12} = \Z_m \times \Z_n</m> for some values of <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>?

       </statement>
       <solution permid="fiv">
         <p permid="cnP">
           In fact yes, <m>\Z_{12} \cong \Z_3 \times \Z_4</m>, since <m>(1,1)</m> has order 12 in the direct product.

        <p permid="ROK">
          Suppose your absent minded professor claims the answer is <q>no</q> and you don't feel like arguing.   Maybe we can do something similar.  Find two subgroups of <m>\Z_{12}</m>, call them <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>, such that <m>H \cap K = \{0\}</m> and <m>HK = \Z_{12}</m>.  In general, <m>HK = \{h\ast k \st h \in H, k \in K\}</m>; here it would be better to write <m>H+K</m>.

        <p permid="IuY">
          Let <m>H = \langle 3 \rangle = \{0, 3, 6, 9\}</m> and <m>K = \langle 4 \rangle = \{0, 4, 8\}</m>.  The intersection <m>H \cap K = \{0\}</m> and every element in <m>\Z_{12}</m> can be written as the sum of something from <m>H</m> and something from <m>K</m>. 
        </p>
        
        <p permid="oCh">
          Notice two things that will be relevant shortly: <m>\langle 3 \rangle \cong \Z_4</m> and <m>\langle 4 \rangle \cong \Z_3</m>, and those two groups were the parts of the direct product version of <m>\Z_{12}</m>.  Second, notice that the elements in <m>\langle 3 \rangle</m> all have order <m>2^k</m> for some <m>k</m>, and the elements of <m>\langle 4 \rangle</m> have order <m>3^k</m> for some <m>k</m> (here just <m>k = 0</m> and <m>k=1</m>).  How very curious.

    <p permid="WyD">
      For any <m>n</m>, the group <m>U(n)</m> is the set of all positive integers less than and relatively prime to <m>n</m>, under multiplication modulo <m>n</m>.  For example we saw that <m>U(8) = \{1,3, 5, 7\}</m>  is a group under multiplication modulo 8.

      Consider the group <m>U(28)</m>.  The table below gives the twelve elements with their orders:

          Now <m>U(28)</m> is NOT isomorphic to <m>\Z_4 \times \Z_3</m>, since that would make <m>\Z_4 \cong G(2)</m>, which is false.
