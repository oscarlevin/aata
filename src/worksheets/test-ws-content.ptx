    <introduction>
        <title>Basic laws for electrical circuits</title>
        <date>Monday, January 7</date>

        <p>This two-page worksheet was generously donated to the sample article by Virgil Pierce at a CuratedCourses workshop in August<nbsp/>2018.  It has default (skinny) left and right margins, but we have specified longer top and bottom margins, with the top being the larger of the two.</p>

        <theorem>
            <title> Ohms Law </title>
            <p> The current through a resistor is proportional to the ratio of the <em> Voltage </em> to the <em> Resistance </em>
                <me> I = \frac{V}{R} </me>
                Or for our purposes
                <me> I R = V </me>
            </p>
        </theorem>

        <theorem>
            <title>Kirchoffs Current Law</title>
            <p> The sum of the currents in a network meeting at a point is zero.
                <me> \sum_{k=1}^n I_k = 0 </me>
            </p>
        </theorem>

        <example>
            <title> Kirchoff's Current Law </title>
            <p> For the circuit below <m> I_1 + I_2 = I_3 </m>.</p>

        <theorem>
            <title> Kirchoffs Voltage Law </title>
            <p> The sum of the voltages around any closed circuit (or subcircuit) is zero.
                <me> \sum_{k=1}^n V_k = 0 </me>
            </p>
        </theorem>

        <p> Kirchoffs Current Law and Kirkoffs Voltage Law combined with Ohms Law gives for any circuit of resistors and sources a linear system that may (or may not) determine the currents.

            <p> Use a variable for each segment inside of the network and set up a system of linear equations restricting the flow. Solve the system.  Note that you should not get a unique solution as traffic should be able to flow through the network in various ways. </p>
