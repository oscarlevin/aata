      <title>Geometric Constructions</title>
      <introduction permid="Tof">
        <p permid="vhh">
          In ancient Greece, three classic problems were posed.
          These problems are geometric in nature and involve straightedge-and-compass constructions from what is now high school geometry;
          that is, we are allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve them.
          The problems can be stated as follows.

          <ol permid="gWl">
            <li permid="CEp">
              <p permid="pUy">
                Given an arbitrary angle,
                can one trisect the angle into three equal subangles using only a straightedge and compass?
              </p>
            </li>

            <li permid="iLy">
              <p permid="WbH">
                Given an arbitrary circle,
                can one construct a square with the same area using only a straightedge and compass?
              </p>
            </li>

            <li permid="OSH">
              <p permid="CiQ">
                Given a cube,
                can one construct the edge of another cube having twice the volume of the original?
                Again, we are only allowed to use a straightedge and compass to do the construction.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          After puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years,
          each of these constructions was finally shown to be impossible.
          We will use the theory of fields to provide a proof that the solutions do not exist.
          It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each of these three geometric problems came from abstract algebra.
        </p>

        <p permid="boq">
          First, let us determine more specifically what we mean by a straightedge and compass,
          and also examine the nature of these problems in a bit more depth.
          To begin with, <em>a straightedge is not a ruler</em>.
          We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge.
          It is merely a tool for drawing a line through two points.
          The statement that the trisection of an arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to trisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction.
          Certainly it is possible to trisect an angle in special cases.
          We can construct a <m>30^\circ</m> angle;
          hence, it is possible to trisect a <m>90^\circ</m> angle.
          However, we will show that it is impossible to construct a <m>20^\circ</m> angle.
          Therefore, we cannot trisect a <m>60^\circ</m> angle.

              Let <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> be constructible numbers.
              We must show that <m>\alpha + \beta</m>,

              We can assume that both <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are positive with <m>\alpha \gt \beta</m>.
              It is quite obvious how to construct
              <m>\alpha + \beta</m> and <m>\alpha - \beta</m>.
              To find a line segment with length <m>\alpha \beta</m>,
              we assume that <m>\beta \gt 1</m> and construct the triangle in <xref ref="figure-multiplication-construction"/> such that triangles
              <m>\triangle ABC</m> and <m>\triangle ADE</m> are similar.
              Since <m>\alpha / 1 = x / \beta</m>,
              the line segment <m>x</m> has length <m>\alpha \beta</m>.
              A similar construction can be made if <m>\beta \lt 1</m>.
              We will leave it as an exercise to show that the same triangle can be used to construct
