  <title>Introduction</title>

    <p permid="ThL">
      Recall that a <term>field</term> is a commutative division ring.  That is, a field is a type of ring (i.e., a set together with two operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying the ring axioms).  The ring is commutative (meaning <em>multiplication</em> commutes; addition is commutative in all rings), and every non-zero element in the ring has a multiplicative inverse.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="zoU">
      We have seen only a few examples of fields so far: certainly the rational numbers <m>\Q</m> are a field, as are the real numbers <m>\R</m> and the complex numbers <m>\C</m>.  We have also considered <em>finite</em> fields such as <m>\Z_3</m>, <m>\Z_5</m>, and <m>\Z_7</m> (but not <m>\Z_6</m> which is not even an integral domain). 
      
    </p>
    <p permid="fwd">
      In fact, we have seen other fields as well: <m>\Q[x]/\langle x - 1\rangle</m> is a field, which happens to be isomorphic to <m>\Q</m>.  Another example is <m>\Q[x]/\langle x^2 - 2\rangle</m>, which is not isomorphic to <m>\Q</m>, but still happens to be a field.   When we considered quotient ring like these before, we focused on its structure as a quotient ring, not worrying too much about its structure as a field.  That is about to change.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="LDm">      
      A reasonable place to start is to consider how different fields relate to each other.  This is not unlike studying <em>subgroups</em> to better understand groups, or subrings and ideals to better understand rings.  One notable difference is that with fields, we often think about expanding a smaller field into a larger one, rather than restricting a larger group into a (smaller) subgroup.

      Given some field <m>F</m>, we can ask whether it is contained in a larger field. Think of the rational numbers,
      which reside inside the real numbers,
      while in turn, the real numbers live inside the complex numbers.
      We would say that the rational numbers are a <term>subfield</term> of the real numbers, or say that the real numbers are a <term>extension field</term> of the rational numbers.  Indeed, we often think of the real numbers as the field you get by adding all the <q>gaps</q> in the number line to the rational numbers; we extend the rationals to get the reals.  Similarly, if you start with the real numbers and <q>throw in</q> the imaginary number <m>i</m>, you get the complex numbers (an extension field of both <m>\Q</m> and <m>\R</m>).  The smaller field <m>F</m> is called the <term>base field</term>.
      We write <m>F \subset E</m>.
    </p>
    
    
    <p permid="XRE">
      Are there other fields hanging out around these traditional choices?  Is there a field <em>between</em> <m>\Q</m> and <m>\R</m>?  We will see that the answer to this is an overwhelming <em>yes</em>!  Most of what we  mean by <em>field theory</em> is precisely the study of fields that are extensions of <m>\Q</m>.  
    </p>
    
    <p permid="DYN">
      It is not at all obvious where to start looking for fields between <m>\Q</m> and <m>\R</m>.  We could start with <m>\R</m> and eliminate numbers, but this does not do much for us.  We really want to extend <m>\Q</m>. What can we add to this already infinite set?  We choose to add <em>roots of polynomials</em>!  This will have the added benefit of helping us to study the polynomials as well.
      </p>
  
    <p permid="qxo">
      More specifically if we are given a field <m>F</m> and a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>,
      we can ask whether or not we can find a field <m>E</m> containing <m>F</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> factors into linear factors over <m>E[x]</m>.
      For example, if we consider the polynomial
      <me permid="pGq">
        p(x) = x^4 -5 x^2 + 6
      </me>
      in <m>\Q[x]</m>,
      then <m>p(x)</m> factors as <m>(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)</m>.
      However, both of these factors are irreducible in <m>\Q[x]</m>.
      If we wish to find a zero of <m>p(x)</m>,
      we must (and can) go to a larger field.
      Certainly the field of real numbers will work, since
      <me permid="VNz">
        p(x) = (x - \sqrt{2} ) (x + \sqrt{2} )( x - \sqrt{3})(x + \sqrt{3})
      </me>.
      It is possible to find a smaller field in which <m>p(x)</m> has a zero, namely
      <me permid="BUI">
        {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} ) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}
      </me>.
      Our goal is to compute and study such fields for arbitrary polynomials over a field <m>F</m>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="kfW">
      Before proceeding though, we should probably convince ourselves that <m>E = \Q(\sqrt{2})</m> really is a field.   First, why is this a ring?  Well, <m>E</m> is a subset of <m>\R</m>, so all we need to check is that it is a subring of <m>\R</m>.  If we take two elements <m>a+b\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>c + d \sqrt{2}</m>, is their sum, difference, and product still in <m>E</m>?  The only one of these that is not obvious is the product.  But,
      <me permid="IIG">
        (a+b\sqrt{2})(c+d\sqrt{2}) = ac+2bd + (ad + bc)\sqrt{2}
      </me>,
      which has the correct form to be in <m>E</m>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="Qnf">
      What about multiplicative inverses though?  Does every <m>a+b\sqrt{2}</m>, with <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> not both zero, have an inverse?  In this example, it is not too difficult to see the answer is yes.  In fact, we can take 
      <me permid="oPP">
        (a+b\sqrt 2)\inv = \frac{a}{a^2 - 2b^2} - \frac{b}{a^2 - 2b^2}\sqrt{2}
      </me>.
      This was found by rationalizing the denominator of <m>\frac{1}{a+b\sqrt{2}}</m> by multiplying by <m>a-b\sqrt{2}</m> in both the numerator and denominator.  That works fine for this simple example, but we will need to think about other methods for more complicated extensions.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="wuo">
      Here is another example:
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-fields-q-sqrt2" permid="qbC">
      <p permid="oIb">
        Let's start with <m>\Q(\sqrt{2})</m> as our base field, and take another extension.  That is, let
        <me permid="ibR">
          F = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{2}\,) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}
        </me>
        and let <m>E =  {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,)</m> be the smallest field containing both
        <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and the real number <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m>.
        For now, assume both <m>E</m> and <m>F</m> are fields, so they are both extension fields of the rational numbers.
        We claim that <m>E</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m>.
        To see this,
        we need only show that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is in <m>E</m>.
        Since <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is in <m>E</m>,
        <m>1 / (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,) = \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m> must also be in <m>E</m>.
        Taking linear combinations of
        <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m>,
        we find that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and
        <m>\sqrt{3}</m> must both be in <m>E</m>.
      </p>
      
      <p permid="naC">
        Note that this also shows that <m>E</m> is an extension field of <m>\Q(\sqrt{3})</m>.  Later we will consider how <m>E</m> relates to the fields <m>\Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})</m>, the smallest field that contains both <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3}</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <p permid="cBx">
      The example above make sense using real numbers we already know about.  Our next goal will be to simply add a arbitrary root of a polynomial, perhaps without even knowing which real (or complex) number that root is.  Surprisingly, this will work!  To get a feel for this, attempt the problems on the following activity.
