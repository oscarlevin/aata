      Previously, we saw that the field <m>E = \Q(\sqrt[4]{3},i)</m> was the splitting field for the polynomial <m>x^4-3</m> and that the Galois group <m>G(E/\Q)</m> was isomorphic to <m>D_4</m>.  Now let's explore the solvability of the Galois group and whether the polynomial <m>x^4 - 3</m> is solvable by radicals.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Verify that <m>D_4</m> (i.e., the Galois group) is solvable.  You have done everything you need for this already, you just need to put the pieces together with the definition of <em>solvable</em>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Pick a subnormal series that witnesses that <m>D_4</m> is solvable, and look at the corresponding series of subfields of <m>E</m> (i.e., the subfields that are fixfields for the subgroups).  Verify that each of these are <em>normal</em> field extensions (i.e., that they are themselves splitting fields).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be one of the fixfields from the previous part.  What are the elements of the Galois group <m>G(F/\Q)</m> and how do these relate to the Galois groups <m>G(E/\Q)</m> and <m>G(E/F)</m>?  Illustrate the connection using example elements.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Pick a non-normal subgroup of <m>D_4</m> and consider its fixfield.  Demonstrate that the fixfield is not a normal extension. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

     <statement>
       <p>
         Find a degree 5 polynomial whose Galois group is isomorphic to <m>S_5</m>.  Explain how you know your example works and what the significance is.  Your example should be different from the one we discuss in class.

         Bonus (worth 5000 points): Express the roots of the polynomial you found in the previous question in terms of rational numbers, field, operations, and radicals (square roots, cube roots, etc).
