          The identity can be written as <m>\varepsilon = (13)(24)(35)(14)(12)(15)(34)(45)</m>. Mimic the proof that <m>\varepsilon</m> must be even and show how to eliminate <m>x = 5</m> from the product of transpositions and write <m>\varepsilon</m> as the product of 2 fewer transpositions in the process.  Show all intermediate steps.

          Bonus: One way you could prove that <m>|A_n| = \frac{n!}{2}</m> is to show that <m>S_n</m> has an equal number of even permutations as odd permutations.  One way you could do this is by finding a bijection from the set of even permutations to the set of odd permutations.  Define <m>f:A_n \to \overline{A_n}</m> (here <m>\overline{A_n}</m> is the compliment of <m>A_n</m>, so the set of all odd permutations) by 
          <m>f(\tau) = (12)\tau</m>.

          Prove that <m>f</m> really is a bijection.  Careful: there are multiple ways to write permutations as products of transpositions.
