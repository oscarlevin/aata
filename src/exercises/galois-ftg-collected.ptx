      Previously, we saw that the field <m>E = \Q(\sqrt[4]{3},i)</m> was the splitting field for the polynomial <m>x^4-3</m>.  We also claimed that there were 8 intermediate fields between <m>\Q</m> and <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{3},i)</m> (so 10 fields total in the picture).  Let's explore what these could be.
      <ol permid="pzW">
        <li permid="VHf">
          <p permid="ujP">
            Describe the 8 automorphisms in <m>G(E/\Q)</m>.  The Galois group is isomorphic to <m>D_4</m>, so you should describe both what each element does to elements in the field and which element of <m>D_4</m> they correspond to.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li permid="BOo">
          <p permid="aqY">
            One of the subfields of <m>E</m> is <m>\Q(\sqrt{3})</m>.  Find the <em>fixer</em> of this subfield.  That is, find the subgroup of <m>G(E/\Q)</m> that corresponds to this subfield.  How many elements does it have, and how does this relate to the degrees around <m>\Q(\sqrt{3})</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li permid="hVx">
          <p permid="Gyh">
            Pick your favorite non-trivial subgroup of <m>D_4</m> that you did not just describe in the previous part, and find the <em>fixfield</em> of it.  That is, find the subfield of <m>E</m> that corresponds to your subgroup.  Again, compare sizes, indexes, and degrees.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li permid="OcG">
          <p permid="mFq">
            Bonus: Complete the lattice of subgroups of <m>D_4</m> and lattice of subfields of <m>E</m>.
