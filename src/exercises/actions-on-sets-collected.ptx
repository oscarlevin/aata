      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be the additive group of real numbers, <m>(\R,+)</m> and let <m>X = \R^2</m> be the real plane.  For each point <m>P \in X</m> and each <m>r \in G</m>, define <m>(r,P)</m> to be the point <m>P</m> lands on after rotating the plane counterclockwise about the origin through <m>r</m> radians.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Prove that <m>X</m> is a <m>G</m>-set.  That is, prove that the procedure above defines an action of <m>G</m> on <m>X</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Pick a point <m>P</m> other than the origin.  Describe geometrically the orbit containing <m>P</m>.  That is, find <m>\mathcal O_P</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Find the stabilizer subgroup of <m>P</m> (i.e., the group <m>G_P</m>) for the point <m>P</m> you picked above.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Consider the group elements <m>g = \pi</m> and <m>h = 2\pi</m>.  Find the fixed points sets <m>X_g</m> and <m>X_h</m>.  Are there any other fixed point sets for other choices of group elements?  Briefly explain.
