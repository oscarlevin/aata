          Write up a careful argument for question 4 from the activity <xref ref="ws_fields-constructable-numbers" text="custom">Constructible Numbers</xref>: Prove that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constructible numbers, with <m>b \ne 0</m>, then <m>a/b</m> is also constructible.

          As suggested in the worksheet, you will modify the argument that <m>a\cdot b</m> is constructible when <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are.  That is, you should use similar triangles.  Make sure you explain why you can construct the similar triangles you need, and also why the side you find really is <m>a/b</m>.
