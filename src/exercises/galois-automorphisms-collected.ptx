    <p permid="xev">
      Consider the polynomial <m>a(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 21</m> in <m>\Q[x]</m>.
      <ol permid="HDA">
        <li permid="nKJ">
          <p permid="suC">
            Find the splitting field <m>E</m> over <m>\Q</m>.  Draw a tower diagram including all intermediate fields and their degrees.  Hint: start by factoring <m>a(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li permid="TRS">
          <p permid="YBL">
            Let <m>\Q(\alpha) \ne \Q(\beta)</m> be different intermediate fields between <m>\Q</m> and <m>E</m>.  Explain why there is NOT an isomorphism from <m>\Q(\alpha)</m> to <m>\Q(\beta)</m> that sends <m>\alpha</m> to <m>\beta</m>.  Then explain why there is no isomorphism between these fields at all.
          </p>

          <p permid="EIU">
            Describe a non-trivial <term>automorphism</term> of <m>E</m>.  Explain how you know your example works.  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li permid="ggk">
          <p permid="kQd">
            Describe the Galois group <m>G(E/\Q)</m>.  Be sure to explicitly say what each element of the group is, as well as say what <q>standard</q> group it is isomorphic to.

          <p permid="QXm">
            Bonus! The polynomial <m>x^4 - 62x^2 + 625</m> has <m>\sqrt{3}+2\sqrt{7}</m> as a root.  Use your results from the previous parts to find the three other roots of this polynomial.
