    <introduction>
      <p>
        All the questions below will consider the number <m>a = \sqrt{3+\sqrt[3]{2}}</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Verify that <m>a = \sqrt{3 + \sqrt[3]{2}}</m> is algebraic.  Then explain why you don't yet know whether the polynomial you found was the minimum polynomial.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Write down a basis for <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})</m> and say what <m>[\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}):\Q]</m> is, and why this makes sense.
          Then find <m>[\Q(a):\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})]</m> and a basis for <m>\Q(a)</m> over <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the previous question to find a basis for <m>\Q(a)</m> over <m>\Q</m> and then say what <m>[\Q(a):\Q]</m> must be.  Then give a different basis for <m>\Q(a)</m> over <m>\Q</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using all of your work above, find the <em>minimal</em> polynomial for <m>a</m> over <m>\Q</m> and prove it is irreducible (using the previous question).
