    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's prove Cayley's theorem.  Here is the overall structure, including the <q>big idea</q>.  After this, you are asked to provide the details.
      </p>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a graph.  We will define a group of permuations <m>\overline{G}</m> that is isomorphic to <m>G</m>.
          For any <m>g \in G</m>, define a  function
           <m>\lambda_g : G \rightarrow G</m> by <m>\lambda_g(a) = ga</m>.
           [Show <m>\lambda_g</m> is a permutation of <m>G</m>, i.e., a bijection.]
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we are ready to define our group <m>\overline{G}</m>.
          Let
          <me>
            \overline{G} = \{ \lambda_g \st g \in G \}
          </me>.
          We must show that <m>\overline{G}</m> is a group (where the operation is composition of functions).   [Show that <m>\overline{G}</m> is subgroup of <m>S_G</m> by showing it contains the identity, is closed under the operation, and is closed under inverses.]
        </p>

        <p>
          We can define an isomorphism from <m>G</m> to
          <m>\overline{G}</m> by <m>\phi : g \mapsto \lambda_g</m>.  We must prove this is really an isomorphism.  [Show that <m>\phi</m> is a bijection and satisfies the homomorphism property.]
        </p>
      </proof>
      <p>
        Now fill in the gaps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prove that <m>\lambda_g</m> is injective (one-to-one).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prove that <m>\lambda_g</m> is surjective (onto).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prove that <m>\overline{G}</m> contains the identity.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prove that <m>\overline{G}</m> is closed under the operation (composition).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prove that <m>\overline{G}</m> is closed under inverses.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prove that <m>\phi</m> is injective.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prove that <m>\phi</m> is surjective.   
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Prove that <m>\phi</m> satisfies the homomorphism property.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        To prove a function <m>f:A \to B</m> is injective, suppose <m>f(a) = f(b)</m> and deduce that <m>a = b</m>.  To prove that the function is surjective, assume <m>b \in B</m> and find some <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>f(a) = b</m>.
      </p>
    </hint>
      <!-- <solution>
            <p>
              To show that <m>\lambda_g</m> is one-to-one,
              suppose that <m>\lambda_g(a) = \lambda_g(b)</m>.
              Then
              <me>
                ga =\lambda_g(a) = \lambda_g(b) = gb
              </me>.
              Hence, <m>a = b</m>.
              To show that <m>\lambda_g</m> is onto,
              we must prove that for each <m>a \in G</m>,
              there is a <m>b</m> such that <m>\lambda_g (b) = a</m>.
              Let <m>b = g^{-1} a</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>\overline{G}</m> contains the identity <m>\lambda_e</m>: <m>\lambda_e\circ \lambda_g = \lambda_g</m>.
              We have closure under composition of functions since
              <me>
                (\lambda_g \circ \lambda_h )(a) = \lambda_g(ha) = gha = \lambda_{gh} (a)
              </me>.
              Also,
              <me>
                (\lambda_{g^{-1}} \circ \lambda_g) (a) = \lambda_{g^{-1}} (ga) = g^{-1} g a = a = \lambda_e (a)
              </me>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>\phi</m> is also one-to-one, because if <m>\phi(g)(a) = \phi(h)(a)</m>, then
              <me>
                ga = \lambda_g a = \lambda_h a=  ha
              </me>.
              Hence, <m>g = h</m>.
              That <m>\phi</m> is onto follows from the fact that
              <m>\phi( g ) = \lambda_g</m> for any <m>\lambda_g \in \overline{G}</m>.
              The homomorphism property holds as well:
              <me>
                \phi(gh) = \lambda_{gh} = \lambda_g \lambda_h = \phi(g) \phi(h)
              </me>.
            </p>
      </solution> -->
