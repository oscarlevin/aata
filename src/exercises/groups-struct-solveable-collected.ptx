        Consider the normal series below for <m>\Z_{24}</m>:
        <me>
          \Z_{24} \supset \langle 12 \rangle \supset \{0\}
        </me>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Find the two quotient groups for the series.  Find the <q>standard</q> abelian groups each is isomorphic to.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For the <em>quotient group</em> that is not simple found above, find a non-trivial normal subgroup (of the quotient group).  Then realize the subgroup as a quotient group <m>G'/\langle 12\rangle</m> for some <m>G'</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Demonstrate/explain how this shows us how to build a longer normal series for <m>\Z_{24}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Find two different composition series for <m>\Z_{24}</m> (one can be an extension of what you were working on above).  Then use quotient groups to demonstrate that the two series are <q>isomorphic</q> (and explain what this means).
            </p>
