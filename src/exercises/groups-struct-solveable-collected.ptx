        Consider the normal series below for <m>\Z_{24}</m>:

          \Z_{24} \supset \langle 12 \rangle \supset \{0\}
        </me>.

              Find the two quotient groups for the series.  Find the <q>standard</q> abelian groups each is isomorphic to.

              For the <em>quotient group</em> that is not simple found above, find a non-trivial normal subgroup (of the quotient group).  Then realize the subgroup as a quotient group <m>G'/\langle 12\rangle</m> for some <m>G'</m>

              Find two different composition series for <m>\Z_{24}</m> (one can be an extension of what you were working on above).  Then use quotient groups to demonstrate that the two series are <q>isomorphic</q> (and explain what this means).
