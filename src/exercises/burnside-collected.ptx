You will give 3 to your favorite abstract algebra professor, 2 to your next favorite professor, and 1 to your third favorite.  You know how to make 4 different types of pies.  How man different pie-to-professor combinations can you create?  Use Burnside's lemma to explain how this relates to the <m>X</m> and <m>G</m> in this problem.
