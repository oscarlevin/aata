  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the field <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}, i)</m>.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is this a splitting field for some polynomial in <m>\Q[x]</m>?  If so, what is the degree of that polynomial.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the <m>[Q(\sqrt[4]{3}, i):\Q]</m>?  Explain how you know.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            It turns out that there are exactly 8 different fields between <m>\Q</m> and <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}, i)</m>.  Find at least four of these (more if you can) and draw a large tower diagram showing how these are related (with degrees marked appropriately).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Bonus! (but not really that hard, just not something we have done in a while): Prove that the fields <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{3})</m> and <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}i)</m> are isomorphic, but not equal.  Note, this fact might be helpful for the previous parts.
