  <title>More of the Structure of Groups</title>
  <introduction permid="YBb">
    <p permid="PKf">
      The ultimate goal of group theory is to classify all groups up to isomorphism;
      that is, given a particular group,
      we should be able to match it up with a known group via an isomorphism.
      For example,
      we have already proved that any finite cyclic group of order <m>n</m> is isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>;
      hence, we <q>know</q> all finite cyclic groups.
      It is probably not reasonable to expect that we will ever know all groups;
      however, we can often classify certain types of groups or distinguish between groups in special cases.
    </p>

    <p permid="vRo">
      In this chapter we will characterize all finite abelian groups.
      <!-- We shall also investigate groups with sequences of subgroups.
      If a group has a sequence of subgroups, say
      <me permid="Dao">
        G = H_n \supset H_{n - 1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}
      </me>,
      where each subgroup <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1}</m> and each of the factor groups <m>H_{i+1}/H_i</m> is abelian,
      then <m>G</m> is a solvable group.
      In addition to allowing us to distinguish between certain classes of groups,
      solvable groups turn out to be central to the study of solutions to polynomial equations. -->
