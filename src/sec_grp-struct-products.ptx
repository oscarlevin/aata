          Given two groups <m>G</m> and <m>H</m>,
          it is possible to construct a new group from the Cartesian product of <m>G</m> and <m>H</m>,
          <m>G \times H</m>.
          Conversely, given a large group,
          it is sometimes possible to decompose the group;
          that is, a group is sometimes isomorphic to the direct product of two smaller groups.
          Rather than studying a large group <m>G</m>,
          it is often easier to study the component groups of <m>G</m>.

          If <m>(G,\cdot)</m> and <m>(H, \circ)</m> are groups,
          then we can make the Cartesian product of <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> into a new group.
          As a set, our group is just the ordered pairs
          <m>(g, h) \in G \times H</m> where <m>g \in G</m> and <m>h \in H</m>.
          We can define a binary operation on <m>G \times H</m> by

          </me>
          that is, we just multiply elements in the first coordinate as we do in <m>G</m> and elements in the second coordinate as we do in <m>H</m>.
          We have specified the particular operations <m>\cdot</m> and <m>\circ</m> in each group here for the sake of clarity;
          we usually just write <m>(g_1, h_1)(g_2, h_2) = (g_1  g_2, h_1 h_2)</m>.

              Let <m>G</m> be the internal direct product of subgroups <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>.
              Then <m>G</m> is isomorphic to <m>H \times K</m>.

          </statement>

          <proof permid="ukF">
            <p permid="pId">
              Since <m>G</m> is an internal direct product,
              we can write any element <m>g \in G</m> as <m>g =hk</m> for some <m>h \in H</m> and some <m>k \in K</m>.
              Define a map <m>\phi : G \rightarrow H \times K</m> by <m>\phi(g) = (h,k)</m>.
            </p>

            <p permid="VPm">
              The first problem that we must face is to show that <m>\phi</m> is a well-defined map;
              that is, we must show that <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are uniquely determined by <m>g</m>.
              Suppose that <m>g = hk=h'k'</m>.
              Then <m>h^{-1} h'= k (k')^{-1}</m> is in both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>,
              so it must be the identity.
              Therefore, <m>h = h'</m> and <m>k = k'</m>,
              which proves that <m>\phi</m> is, indeed, well-defined.
            </p>

            <p permid="BWv">
              To show that <m>\phi</m> preserves the group operation,
              let <m>g_1 = h_1 k_1</m> and <m>g_2 = h_2 k_2</m> and observe that
              <md permid="MYq">
                <mrow>\phi( g_1 g_2 ) &amp; = \phi( h_1 k_1 h_2 k_2 )</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = \phi(h_1  h_2 k_1 k_2)</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = (h_1  h_2, k_1 k_2)</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = (h_1, k_1)( h_2, k_2)</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = \phi( g_1 ) \phi(  g_2 )</mrow>

              We will leave the proof that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one and onto as an exercise.
