  <title>Rings</title>
  <introduction permid="VGI">
    <p permid="BsF">
      Up to this point we have studied sets with a single binary operation satisfying certain axioms,
      but we are often more interested in working with sets that have two binary operations.
      For example,
      one of the most natural algebraic structures to study is the integers with the operations of addition and multiplication.
      These operations are related to one another by the distributive property.
      If we consider a set with two such related binary operations satisfying certain axioms,
      we have an algebraic structure called a ring.
      In a ring we add and multiply elements such as real numbers,
      complex numbers, matrices, and functions.

      Notice that the first four axioms simply require that a ring be an abelian group under addition,

        As we have mentioned previously, the integers form a ring.
        In fact, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is an integral domain.
        Certainly if <m>a b = 0</m> for two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
        either <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>.
        However, <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is not a field.
        There is no integer that is the multiplicative inverse of <m>2</m>,
        since <m>1/2</m> is not an integer.
        The only integers with multiplicative inverses are <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-rings-field" permid="KxJ">
      <p permid="dVo">
        Under the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication,
        all of the familiar number systems are rings:
        the rationals, <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>;
        the real numbers, <m>{\mathbb R}</m>;
        and the complex numbers, <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
        Each of these rings is a field.

    <example xml:id="example-rings-zn" permid="qES">
      <p permid="Kcx">
        We can define the product of two elements <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> by <m>ab \pmod{n}</m>.
        For instance, in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>,
        <m>5 \cdot 7 \equiv 11 \pmod{12}</m>.
        This product makes the abelian group <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> into a ring.
        Certainly <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is a commutative ring;
        however, it may fail to be an integral domain.
        If we consider <m>3 \cdot 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{12}</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>,
        it is easy to see that a product of two nonzero elements in the ring can be equal to zero.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p permid="Jlz">
      A nonzero element <m>a</m> in a ring <m>R</m> is called a <term>zero divisor</term>
          <idx><h>Zero divisor</h></idx>
      if there is a nonzero element <m>b</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>ab = 0</m>.
      In the previous example,
      <m>3</m> and <m>4</m> are zero divisors in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>.

      <p permid="qjG">
        In calculus the continuous real-valued functions on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> form a commutative ring.
        We add or multiply two functions by adding or multiplying the values of the functions.
        If <m>f(x) = x^2</m> and <m>g(x) = \cos x</m>,
        then <m>(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = x^2 + \cos x</m> and <m>(fg)(x) = f(x) g(x) = x^2 \cos x</m>.

        The <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices with entries in

        This ring is noncommutative,
        since it is usually the case that <m>AB \neq BA</m>.
        Also, notice that we can have <m>AB = 0</m> when neither <m>A</m> nor <m>B</m> is zero.

        If <m>i^2 = -1</m>, then the set

        <notation>
          <usage>\mathbb Z[i]</usage>
          <description>the Gaussian integers</description>
        </notation>

        It is easily seen that the Gaussian integers are a subring of the complex numbers since they are closed under addition and multiplication.
        Let <m>\alpha = a + bi</m> be a unit in <m>{\mathbb Z}[ i ]</m>.
        Then <m>\overline{\alpha} = a - bi</m> is also a unit since if <m>\alpha \beta = 1</m>,
        then <m>\overline{\alpha} \overline{\beta} = 1</m>.
        If <m>\beta = c + di</m>, then
        <me permid="JVt">
          1 = \alpha \beta \overline{\alpha} \overline{\beta} = (a^2 + b^2 )(c^2 + d^2)
        </me>.
        Therefore, <m>a^2 + b^2</m> must either be <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m>;
        or, equivalently, <m>a + bi = \pm 1</m> or <m>a + bi = \pm i</m>.
        Therefore, units of this ring are <m>\pm 1</m> and <m>\pm i</m>;
        hence, the Gaussian integers are not a field.
        We will leave it as an exercise to prove that the Gaussian integers are an integral domain.

          The map <m>\lambda_a</m> is one-to-one,
          since for <m>d_1, d_2 \in D^*</m>,
          <me permid="CqU">
            ad_1 = \lambda_a(d_1) = \lambda_a(d_2) = ad_2
          </me>
          implies <m>d_1 = d_2</m> by left cancellation.
          Since <m>D^\ast</m> is a finite set,
          the map <m>\lambda_a</m> must also be onto;
          hence, for some <m>d \in D^\ast</m>,
          <m>\lambda_a(d) = ad = 1</m>.
          Therefore, <m>a</m> has a left inverse.
          Since <m>D</m> is commutative,
          <m>d</m> must also be a right inverse for <m>a</m>.
          Consequently, <m>D</m> is a field.

        In this particular section we are especially interested in certain ideals of commutative rings.
        These ideals give us special types of factor rings.
        More specifically,
        we would like to characterize those ideals <m>I</m> of a commutative ring <m>R</m> such that <m>R/I</m> is an integral domain or a field.
      </p>

      <p permid="NGX">
        A proper ideal <m>M</m> of a ring <m>R</m> is a
        <term>maximal ideal</term>

        of <m>R</m> if the ideal <m>M</m> is not a proper subset of any ideal of <m>R</m> except <m>R</m> itself.
        That is, <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal if for any ideal <m>I</m> properly containing <m>M</m>,
        <m>I = R</m>.
        The following theorem completely characterizes maximal ideals for commutative rings with identity in terms of their corresponding factor rings.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="theorem-maximal-ideal-field" permid="oPF">
        <statement>
          <p permid="Ink">
            Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity and <m>M</m> an ideal in <m>R</m>.
            Then <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal of <m>R</m> if and only if <m>R/M</m> is a field.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof permid="yTl">
          <p permid="Ocw">
            Let <m>M</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>R</m>.
            If <m>R</m> is a commutative ring,
            then <m>R/M</m> must also be a commutative ring.
            Clearly, <m>1 + M</m> acts as an identity for <m>R/M</m>.
            We must also show that every nonzero element in <m>R/M</m> has an inverse.
            If <m>a + M</m> is a nonzero element in <m>R/M</m>, then <m>a \notin M</m>.
            Define <m>I</m> to be the set <m>\{ ra + m : r \in R \text{ and } m \in M \}</m>.
            We will show that <m>I</m> is an ideal in <m>R</m>.
            The set <m>I</m> is nonempty since <m>0a+0=0</m> is in <m>I</m>.
            If <m>r_1 a + m_1</m> and <m>r_2 a + m_2</m> are two elements in <m>I</m>, then
            <me permid="cIR">
              (r_1 a + m_1) - ( r_2 a + m_2) = (r_1 - r_2)a + (m_1 - m_2)
            </me>
            is in <m>I</m>.
            Also, for any <m>r \in R</m> it is true that <m>rI \subset I</m>;
            hence, <m>I</m> is closed under multiplication and satisfies the necessary conditions to be an ideal.
            Therefore, by <xref ref="prop-subring"/> and the definition of an ideal,
            <m>I</m> is an ideal properly containing <m>M</m>.
            Since <m>M</m> is a maximal ideal, <m>I=R</m>;
            consequently,
            by the definition of <m>I</m> there must be an <m>m</m> in <m>M</m> and an element <m>b</m> in <m>R</m> such that <m>1=ab+m</m>.
            Therefore,
            <me permid="IQa">
              1 + M = ab + M = ba + M = (a+M)(b+M)

            Conversely, suppose that <m>M</m> is an ideal and <m>R/M</m> is a field.
            Since <m>R/M</m> is a field, it must contain at least two elements:
            <m>0 + M = M</m> and <m>1 + M</m>.
            Hence, <m>M</m> is a proper ideal of <m>R</m>.
            Let <m>I</m> be any ideal properly containing <m>M</m>.
            We need to show that <m>I = R</m>.
            Choose <m>a</m> in <m>I</m> but not in <m>M</m>.
            Since <m>a+ M</m> is a nonzero element in a field,
            there exists an element <m>b +M</m> in <m>R/M</m> such that <m>(a+M)(b+M) = ab + M = 1+M</m>.
            Consequently, there exists an element <m>m \in M</m> such that

        Amalie Emmy Noether,
            <idx><h>Noether, A. Emmy</h></idx>
        one of the outstanding mathematicians of the twentieth century,
        was born in Erlangen, Germany in 1882.
        She was the daughter of Max Noether
            <idx><h>Noether, Max</h></idx>
        (1844<ndash/>1921), a distinguished mathematician at the University of Erlangen.
        Together with Paul Gordon (1837<ndash/>1912), Emmy Noether's father strongly influenced her early education.
        She entered the University of Erlangen at the age of 18.
        Although women had been admitted to universities in England, France,
        and Italy for decades,
        there was great resistance to their presence at universities in Germany.
        Noether was one of only two women among the university's 986 students.
        After completing her doctorate under Gordon in 1907,
        she continued to do research at Erlangen,
        occasionally lecturing when her father was ill.
      </p>

      <p permid="IBF">
        Noether went to Göttingen to study in 1916.
        David Hilbert
            <idx><h>Hilbert, David</h></idx>
        and Felix Klein
            <idx><h>Klein, Felix</h></idx>
        tried unsuccessfully to secure her an appointment at Göttingen.
        Some of the faculty objected to women lecturers, saying,
        <q>What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and are expected to learn at the feet of a woman?</q> Hilbert,
        annoyed at the question, responded,
        <q>Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of a candidate is an argument against her admission as a Privatdozent.
        After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse.</q>
        At the end of World War I, attitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women.
        After Noether passed her habilitation examination in 1919,
        she was given a title and was paid a small sum for her lectures.
      </p>

      <p permid="oIO">
        In 1922, Noether became a Privatdozent at Göttingen.
        Over the next 11 years she used axiomatic methods to develop an abstract theory of rings and ideals.
        Though she was not good at lecturing, Noether was an inspiring teacher.
        One of her many students was B. L. van der Waerden,
        author of the first text treating abstract algebra from a modern point of view.
        Some of the other mathematicians Noether influenced or closely worked with were Alexandroff, Artin, Brauer, Courant, Hasse, Hopf, Pontryagin,
        von Neumann,
        and Weyl.
        One of the high points of her career was an invitation to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1932.
        In spite of all the recognition she received from her colleagues, Noether's abilities were never recognized as they should have been during her lifetime.
        She was never promoted to full professor by the Prussian academic bureaucracy.
      </p>

      <p permid="UPX">
        In 1933, Noether, who was Jewish,
        was banned from participation in all academic activities in Germany.
        She emigrated to the United States,
        took a position at Bryn Mawr College,
        and became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
        Noether died suddenly on April 14, 1935.
        After her death she was eulogized by such notable scientists as Albert Einstein.

    <p permid="Dwn">
      One interesting application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the design of computer software is that the theorem allows us to break up a calculation involving large integers into several less formidable calculations.
      A computer will handle integer calculations only up to a certain size due to the size of its processor chip,
      which is usually a 32 or 64-bit processor chip.
      For example,
      the largest integer available on a computer with a 64-bit processor chip is
      <me permid="Ppg">
        2^{63} - 1 = 9{,}223{,}372{,}036{,}854{,}775{,}807
      </me>.
      Larger processors such as 128 or 256-bit have been proposed or are under development.
      There is even talk of a 512-bit processor chip.
      The largest integer that such a chip could store with be <m>2^{511} - 1</m>,
      which would be a 154 digit number.
      However, we would need to deal with much larger numbers to break sophisticated encryption schemes.
    </p>

    <p permid="jDw">
      Special software is required for calculations involving larger integers which cannot be added directly by the machine.
      By using the Chinese Remainder Theorem we can break down large integer additions and multiplications into calculations that the computer can handle directly.
      This is especially useful on parallel processing computers which have the ability to run several programs concurrently.
    </p>

    <p permid="PKF">
      Most computers have a single central processing unit (CPU) containing one processor chip and can only add two numbers at a time.
      To add a list of ten numbers,
      the CPU must do nine additions in sequence.
      However, a parallel processing computer has more than one CPU. A computer with 10 CPUs, for example,
      can perform 10 different additions at the same time.
      If we can take a large integer and break it down into parts,
      sending each part to a different CPU, then by performing several additions or multiplications simultaneously on those parts,
      we can work with an integer that the computer would not be able to handle as a whole.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-rings-2134x1531" permid="Jsq">
      <p permid="IXe">
        Suppose that we wish to multiply <m>2134</m> by <m>1531</m>.
        We will use the integers <m>95</m>, <m>97</m>,
        <m>98</m>, and <m>99</m> because they are relatively prime.
        We can break down each integer into four parts:

          <mrow>1531 &amp; \equiv  46 \pmod{99}</mrow>
        </md>.
        Multiplying the corresponding equations, we obtain
        <md permid="HKH">
          <mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  44 \cdot 11  \equiv  9 \pmod{95}</mrow>
          <mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  0  \cdot 76  \equiv  0 \pmod{97}</mrow>
          <mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  76 \cdot 61  \equiv  30 \pmod{98}</mrow>
          <mrow>2134 \cdot 1531 &amp; \equiv  55 \cdot 46  \equiv 55 \pmod{99}</mrow>
        </md>.
        Each of these four computations can be sent to a different processor if our computer has several CPUs.
        By the above calculation,
        we know that <m>2134 \cdot 1531</m> is a solution of the system
        <md permid="nRQ">

          <mrow>x &amp; \equiv  55 \pmod{99}</mrow>
        </md>.
        The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that solutions are unique up to modulo <m>95 \cdot 97 \cdot 98 \cdot 99 = 89{,}403{,}930</m>.
        Solving this system of congruences for <m>x</m> tells us that <m>2134 \cdot 1531 = 3{,}267{,}154</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="pen">
        The conversion of the computation into the four subcomputations will take some computing time.
        In addition,
        solving the system of congruences can also take considerable time.
        However, if we have many computations to be performed on a particular set of numbers,
        it makes sense to transform the problem as we have done above and to perform the necessary calculations simultaneously.
