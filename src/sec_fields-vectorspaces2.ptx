      Let <m>E</m> be a field extension of a field <m>F</m>.
      If we regard <m>E</m> as a vector space over <m>F</m>,
      then we can bring the machinery of linear algebra to bear on the problems that we will encounter in our study of fields.
      The elements in the field <m>E</m> are vectors;
      the elements in the field <m>F</m> are scalars.
      We can think of addition in <m>E</m> as adding vectors.
      When we multiply an element in <m>E</m> by an element of <m>F</m>,
      we are multiplying a vector by a scalar.
      This view of field extensions is especially fruitful if a field extension <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> is a finite dimensional vector space over <m>F</m>,
      and <xref ref="theorem-simple_extension"/> states that
      <m>E = F(\alpha )</m> is finite dimensional vector space over <m>F</m> with basis <m>\{ 1, \alpha, {\alpha}^2, \ldots, {\alpha}^{n - 1} \}</m>.

    <p permid="WiY">
      If an extension field <m>E</m> of a field <m>F</m> is a finite dimensional vector space over <m>F</m> of dimension <m>n</m>,

      <proof permid="kmq">
        <p permid="GbL">
          Let <m>\{ \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \}</m> be a basis for <m>E</m> as a vector space over <m>F</m> and
          <m>\{ \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_m \}</m> be a basis for <m>K</m> as a vector space over <m>E</m>.
          We claim that <m>\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}</m> is a basis for <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>.
          We will first show that these vectors span <m>K</m>.
          Let <m>u \in K</m>.
          Then <m>u = \sum_{j = 1}^{m} b_j \beta_j</m> and <m>b_j = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{ij} \alpha_i</m>,
          where <m>b_j \in E</m> and <m>a_{ij} \in F</m>.
          Then
          <me permid="Fzi">
            u = \sum_{j = 1}^{m} \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{ij} \alpha_i  \right) \beta_j = \sum_{i,j} a_{ij} ( \alpha_i \beta_j )

          So the <m>mn</m> vectors <m>\alpha_i \beta_j</m> must span <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="miU">
          We must show that <m>\{ \alpha_i \beta_j \}</m> are linearly independent.
          Recall that a set of vectors
          <m>v_1, v_2, \ldots,
          v_n</m> in a vector space <m>V</m> are linearly independent if

            c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \cdots + c_n v_n = 0

          <me permid="RNA">

            u = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} ( \alpha_i \beta_j ) = 0
          </me>
          for <m>c_{ij} \in F</m>.
          We need to prove that all of the <m>c_{ij}</m>'s are zero.
          We can rewrite <m>u</m> as
          <me permid="ebS">
            \sum_{j = 1}^{m} \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_{ij} \alpha_i \right) \beta_j = 0
          </me>,
          where <m>\sum_i c_{ij} \alpha_i \in E</m>.
          Since the <m>\beta_j</m>'s are linearly independent over <m>E</m>,
          it must be the case that
          <me permid="Kjb">
            \sum_{i = 1}^n c_{ij} \alpha_i = 0
          </me>
          for all <m>j</m>.
          However, the <m>\alpha_j</m> are also linearly independent  over <m>F</m>.
          Therefore, <m>c_{ij} = 0</m> for all <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>,
          which completes the proof.

        Let us determine an extension field of

        It follows that

        It follows that <m>\sqrt{5}</m> cannot be in <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}\, )</m> either.
        Therefore, <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{5}\, \}</m> is a basis for <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, ) = ( {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{3}\, ))( \sqrt{5}\, )</m> over

      It is a nontrivial fact that every field has a unique algebraic closure.
      The proof is not extremely difficult,
      but requires some rather sophisticated set theory.
      We refer the reader to [3], [4], or [8] for a proof of this result.

      We now state the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,
      first proven by Gauss at the age of 22 in his doctoral thesis.
      This theorem states that every polynomial with coefficients in the complex numbers has a root in the complex numbers.
      The proof of this theorem will be given in <xref ref="galois"/>.
