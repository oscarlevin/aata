              has more unknowns than equations.
              From linear algebra we know that this system has a nontrivial solution,
              say <m>x_i = a_i</m> for <m>i = 1, 2, \ldots, n + 1</m>.
              Since <m>\sigma_1</m> is the identity,

              The problem is that some of the <m>a_i</m>'s may be in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>.
              We must show that this is impossible.
            </p>
            <!-- Corrected typo.  Suggested by K. Brooks. - TWJ 6/15/2012 -->
            <p permid="lhb">
              Suppose that at least one of the <m>a_i</m>'s is in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>.
              By rearranging the <m>\alpha_i</m>'s we may assume that <m>a_1</m> is nonzero.
              Since any nonzero multiple of a solution is also a solution,
              we can also assume that <m>a_1 = 1</m>.
              Of all possible solutions fitting this description,
              we choose the one with the smallest number of nonzero terms.
              Again, by rearranging <m>\alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{n + 1}</m> if necessary,
              we can assume that <m>a_2</m> is in <m>E</m> but not in <m>F</m>.
              Since <m>F</m> is the subfield of <m>E</m> that is fixed elementwise by <m>G</m>,
              there exists a <m>\sigma_i</m> in <m>G</m> such that <m>\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2</m>.
              Applying <m>\sigma_i</m> to each equation in the system,
              we end up with the same homogeneous system,
              since <m>G</m> is a group.
              Therefore, <m>x_1 = \sigma_i(a_1) = 1</m>,
              <m>x_2 = \sigma_i(a_2)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
              <m>x_{n + 1} = \sigma_i(a_{n+1} )</m> is also a solution of the original system.
              We know that a linear combination of two solutions of a homogeneous system is also a solution;
              consequently,
              <md permid="siX">
                <mrow>x_1 &amp; = 1 -1 = 0</mrow>
                <mrow>x_2 &amp; = a_2 - \sigma_i(a_2)</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; \vdots &amp;</mrow>
                <mrow>x_{n + 1} &amp; = a_{n + 1} - \sigma_i(a_{n + 1})</mrow>
              </md>
              must be another solution of the system.
              This is a nontrivial solution because <m>\sigma_i( a_2 ) \neq a_2</m>,
              and has fewer nonzero entries than our original solution.
              This is a contradiction,
              since the number of nonzero solutions to our original solution was assumed to be minimal.
              We can therefore conclude that <m>a_1, \ldots, a_{n + 1} \in F</m>.

              (4) This part takes a little more work.
              Let <m>K</m> be a normal extension of <m>F</m>.
              If <m>\sigma</m> is in <m>G(E/F)</m> and <m>\tau</m> is in <m>G(E/K)</m>,
              we need to show that <m>\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma</m> is in <m>G(E/K)</m>;
              that is, we need to show that
              <m>\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma( \alpha) = \alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha \in K</m>.
              Suppose that <m>f(x)</m> is the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m>.
              Then <m>\sigma( \alpha )</m> is also a root of <m>f(x)</m> lying in <m>K</m>,
              since <m>K</m> is a normal extension of <m>F</m>.
              Hence, <m>\tau( \sigma( \alpha )) = \sigma( \alpha )</m> or <m>\sigma^{-1} \tau \sigma( \alpha) = \alpha</m>.

              Conversely, let <m>G(E/K)</m> be a normal subgroup of <m>G(E/F)</m>.
              We need to show that <m>F = K_{G(K/F)}</m>.
              Let <m>\tau \in G(E/K)</m>.
              For all <m>\sigma \in G(E/F)</m> there exists a
              <m>\overline{\tau} \in G(E/K)</m> such that <m>\tau \sigma = \sigma \overline{\tau}</m>.
              Consequently, for all <m>\alpha \in K</m>
              <me permid="wSQ">

              hence, <m>\sigma( \alpha )</m> must be in the fixed field of <m>G(E/K)</m>.
              Let <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> be the restriction of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>.
              Then <m>\overline{\sigma}</m> is an automorphism of <m>K</m> fixing <m>F</m>,
              since <m>\sigma( \alpha ) \in K</m> for all <m>\alpha \in K</m>;
              hence, <m>\overline{\sigma} \in G(K/F)</m>.
              Next, we will show that the fixed field of <m>G(K/F)</m> is <m>F</m>.
              Let <m>\beta</m> be an element in <m>K</m> that is fixed by all automorphisms in <m>G(K/F)</m>.
              In particular,
              <m>\overline{\sigma}(\beta) = \beta</m> for all <m>\sigma \in G(E/F)</m>.
              Therefore, <m>\beta</m> belongs to the fixed field <m>F</m> of <m>G(E/F)</m>.
            </p>

            <p permid="uAN">
              Finally, we must show that when <m>K</m> is a normal extension of <m>F</m>,

              let <m>\sigma_K</m> be the automorphism of <m>K</m> obtained by restricting <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>.
              Since <m>K</m> is a normal extension,
              the argument in the preceding paragraph shows that <m>\sigma_K \in G( K/F)</m>.
              Consequently, we have a map
              <m>\phi:G(E/F) \rightarrow G(K/F)</m> defined by <m>\sigma \mapsto \sigma_K</m>.
              This map is a group homomorphism since
              <me permid="Jhi">
                \phi( \sigma \tau ) = (\sigma \tau)_K = \sigma_K \tau_K  = \phi( \sigma) \phi( \tau )

              The kernel of <m>\phi</m> is <m>G(E/K)</m>.
              By (2),

                |G(E/F)| / |G(E/K)| = [K:F] = |G(K/F)|
              </me>.
              Hence, the image of <m>\phi</m> is <m>G(K/F)</m> and <m>\phi</m> is onto.
              Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have

        <title>Historical Note</title>
        <p permid="rUC">
          Solutions for the cubic and quartic equations were discovered in the 1500s.
          Attempts to find solutions for the quintic equations puzzled some of history's best mathematicians.
          In 1798, P. Ruffini
              <idx><h>Ruffini, P.</h></idx>
          submitted a paper that claimed no such solution could be found;
          however, the paper was not well received.
          In 1826, Niels Henrik Abel
              <idx><h>Abel, Niels Henrik</h></idx>
          (1802<ndash/>1829) finally offered the first correct proof that quintics are not always solvable by radicals.
        </p>

        <p permid="YbL">
          Abel inspired the work of Évariste Galois.
              <idx><h>Galois, Évariste</h></idx>
          Born in 1811, Galois began to display extraordinary mathematical talent at the age of 14.
          He applied for entrance to the École Polytechnique several times;
          however, he had great difficulty meeting the formal entrance requirements,
          and the examiners failed to recognize his mathematical genius.
          He was finally accepted at the École Normale in 1829.
        </p>

        <p permid="EiU">
          Galois worked to develop a theory of solvability for polynomials.
          In 1829, at the age of 17, Galois presented two papers on the solution of algebraic equations to the Académie des Sciences de Paris.
          These papers were sent to Cauchy,
          who subsequently lost them.
          A third paper was submitted to Fourier,
          who died before he could read the paper.
          Another paper was presented, but was not published until 1846.
        </p>

        <p permid="kqd">
          Galois' democratic sympathies led him into the Revolution of 1830.
          He was expelled from school and sent to prison for his part in the turmoil.
          After his release in 1832,
          he was drawn into a duel possibly over a love affair.
          Certain that he would be killed,
          he spent the evening before his death outlining his work and his basic ideas for research in a long letter to his friend Chevalier.
          He was indeed dead the next day, at the age of 20.
