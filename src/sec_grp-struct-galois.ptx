       <p permid="Qxm">
         Throughout this section we shall assume that all fields have characteristic zero to ensure that irreducible polynomials do not have multiple roots.
         The immediate goal of this section is to determine when the roots of a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> can be computed with a finite number of operations on the coefficients of <m>f(x)</m>.
         The allowable operations are addition, subtraction,
         multiplication, division, and the extraction of <m>n</m>th roots.
         Certainly the solution to the quadratic equation,
         <m>a x^2 + b x +c = 0</m>, illustrates this process:
         <me permid="hJS">
           x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
         </me>.
         The only one of these operations that might demand a larger field is the taking of <m>n</m>th roots.
         We are led to the following definition.

       <p permid="wEv">
         An extension field <m>E</m> of a field <m>F</m> is an

         over <m>F</m> if the splitting field <m>K</m> of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F</m> is contained in an extension of <m>F</m> by radicals.
         Our goal is to arrive at criteria that will tell us whether or not a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> is solvable by radicals by examining the Galois group <m>f(x)</m>.

         We shall prove that a polynomial is solvable by radicals if its Galois group is solvable.

             Then <m>G(E/F)</m> is a solvable group.

         <proof permid="ZQL">
           <p permid="aHW">
             The roots of <m>x^n - a</m> are <m>\sqrt[n]{a}, \omega \sqrt[n]{a}, \ldots, \omega^{n-1} \sqrt[n]{a}</m>,
             where <m>\omega</m> is a primitive <m>n</m>th root of unity.
             Suppose that <m>F</m> contains all of its <m>n</m>th roots of unity.
             If <m>\zeta</m> is one of the roots of  <m>x^n - a</m>,

             and <m>E = F(\zeta)</m>.
             Since <m>G(E/F)</m> permutes the roots <m>x^n - a</m>,
             the elements in  <m>G(E/F)</m> must be determined by their action on these roots.

             Now suppose that <m>F</m> does not contain a primitive <m>n</m>th root of unity.
             Let <m>\omega</m> be a generator of the cyclic group of the <m>n</m>th roots of unity.
             Let <m>\alpha</m> be a zero of <m>x^n - a</m>.
             Since <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\omega \alpha</m> are both in the splitting field of <m>x^n - a</m>,
             <m>\omega = (\omega \alpha)/ \alpha</m> is also in <m>E</m>.
             Let <m>K = F( \omega)</m>.
             Then <m>F \subset K \subset E</m>.
             Since <m>K</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^n - 1</m>,
             <m>K</m> is a normal extension of <m>F</m>.
             Therefore, any automorphism <m>\sigma</m> in

             It must be the case that <m>\sigma( \omega ) = \omega^i</m> for some integer <m>i</m> since all of the zeros of <m>x^n - 1</m> are powers of <m>\omega</m>.
             If <m>\tau( \omega ) = \omega^j</m> is in <m>G(F(\omega)/F)</m>, then

             is a normal series.
             By our previous argument, <m>G(E/F(\omega))</m> is abelian.
             Since

           We will show that <m>f(x) = x^5 - 6 x^3 - 27 x - 3 \in {\mathbb Q}[x]</m> is not solvable.
           We claim that the Galois group of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is <m>S_5</m>.
           By Eisenstein's Criterion,
           <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible and,
           therefore, must be separable.
           The derivative of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>f'(x) = 5 x^4 - 18 x^2 - 27</m>;
           hence, setting <m>f'(x) = 0</m> and solving,
           we find that the only real roots of <m>f'(x)</m> are
           <me permid="vNx">
             x = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{6 \sqrt{6} + 9 }{5} }
           </me>.
           Therefore, <m>f(x)</m> can have at most one maximum and one minimum.
           It is easy to show that <m>f(x)</m> changes sign between <m>-3</m> and <m>-2</m>,
           between <m>-2</m> and <m>0</m>,
           and once again between <m>0</m> and <m>4</m> (<xref ref="figure-galois-4"/>).
           Therefore, <m>f(x)</m> has exactly three distinct real roots.
           The remaining two roots of <m>f(x)</m> must be complex conjugates.
           Let <m>K</m> be the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m>.
           Since <m>f(x)</m> has five distinct roots in <m>K</m> and every automorphism of <m>K</m> fixing
           <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is determined by the way it permutes the roots of <m>f(x)</m>,
           we know that <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q})</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_5</m>.
           Since <m>f</m> is irreducible,
           there is an element in <m>\sigma \in G(K/{\mathbb Q})</m> such that
           <m>\sigma(a) = b</m> for two roots <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> of <m>f(x)</m>.
           The automorphism of <m>{\mathbb C}</m> that takes
           <m>a + bi \mapsto a - bi</m> leaves the real roots fixed and interchanges the complex roots;
           consequently, <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q} )</m> contains a transpostion.
           If <m>\alpha</m> is one of the real roots of <m>f(x)</m>,
           then <m>[\mathbb Q(\alpha) : \mathbb Q] = 5</m>.
           Since <m>\mathbb Q(\alpha)</m> is a subfield of <m>K</m>,
           it must be the case the <m>[K : \mathbb Q]</m> is divisible by 5.
           Since <m>[K : \mathbb Q] = |G(K/{\mathbb Q})|</m> and <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q}) \subset S_5</m>,
           we know that <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q})</m> contains a cycle of length <m>5</m>.
           By <xref ref="lemma-sn-generating"/>,
           <m>S_5</m> is generated by a transposition and an element of order <m>5</m>;
           therefore, <m>G(K/{\mathbb Q} )</m> must be all of <m>S_5</m>.
           By <xref ref="theorem-an-simple"/>, <m>S_5</m> is not solvable.
           Consequently, <m>f(x)</m> cannot be solved by radicals.

       <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>
       <p permid="NCG">
         It seems fitting that the last theorem that we will state and prove is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
         This theorem was first proven by Gauss in his doctoral thesis.
         Prior to Gauss's proof,
         mathematicians suspected that there might exist polynomials over the real and complex numbers having no solutions.
         The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every polynomial over the complex numbers factors into distinct linear factors.

           <p permid="frP">
             Suppose that <m>E</m> is a proper finite field extension of the complex numbers.
             Since any finite extension of a field of characteristic zero is a simple extension,
             there exists an <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that
             <m>E = {\mathbb C}( \alpha )</m> with <m>\alpha</m> the root of an irreducible polynomial <m>f(x)</m> in <m>{\mathbb C}[x]</m>.
             The splitting field <m>L</m> of <m>f(x)</m> is a finite normal separable extension of
             <m>{\mathbb C}</m> that contains <m>E</m>.
             We must show that it is impossible for <m>L</m> to be a proper extension of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
           </p>

           <p permid="LyY">
             Suppose that <m>L</m> is a proper extension of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
             Since <m>L</m> is the splitting field of
             <m>f(x)(x^2 + 1)</m> over <m>{\mathbb R}</m>,
             <m>L</m> is a finite normal separable extension of <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.
             Let <m>K</m> be the fixed field of a Sylow 2-subgroup <m>G</m> of <m>G(L/{\mathbb R})</m>.
             Then <m>L \supset K \supset {\mathbb R}</m> and <m>|G( L / K )| =[L:K]</m>.
             Since <m>[L : {\mathbb R}] = [L:K][K:{\mathbb R}]</m>,
             we know that <m>[K:{\mathbb R}]</m> must be odd.
             Consequently,
             <m>K = {\mathbb R}(\beta)</m> with <m>\beta</m> having a minimal polynomial <m>f(x)</m> of odd degree.
             Therefore, <m>K = {\mathbb R}</m>.
           </p>

           <p permid="rGh">
             We now know that <m>G(L/{\mathbb R})</m> must be a 2-group.
             It follows that <m>G(L / {\mathbb C})</m> is a <m>2</m>-group.
             We have assumed that <m>L \neq {\mathbb C}</m>;
             therefore, <m>|G(L / {\mathbb C})| \geq 2</m>.
             By the first Sylow Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory,
             there exists a subgroup <m>G</m> of
             <m>G(L/{\mathbb C})</m> of index 2 and a field <m>E</m> fixed elementwise by <m>G</m>.
             Then <m>[E:{\mathbb C}] = 2</m> and there exists an element
             <m>\gamma \in E</m> with minimal polynomial
             <m>x^2 + b x + c</m> in <m>{\mathbb C}[x]</m>.
             This polynomial has roots <m>( - b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}\, ) / 2</m> that are in <m>{\mathbb C}</m>,
             since <m>b^2 - 4 c</m> is in <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
             This is impossible; hence, <m>L = {\mathbb C}</m>.

       </theorem>

       <p permid="tJP">
         Although our proof was strictly algebraic,
         we were forced to rely on results from calculus.
         It is necessary to assume the completeness axiom from analysis to show that every polynomial of odd degree has a real root and that every positive real number has a square root.
         It seems that there is no possible way to avoid this difficulty and formulate a purely algebraic argument.
         It is somewhat amazing that there are several elegant proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that use complex analysis.
         It is also interesting to note that we can obtain a proof of such an important theorem from two very different fields of mathematics.
