  <title>Fields</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Our goal in this chapter is to understand the theory of <term>fields</term>, similar to how we studied groups and rings.  The motivation is not altruistic though.  Rather, we will study fields as a canvas in which we can solve other problems, from factoring polynomials to constructing geometric figures with a straight edge and compass.
