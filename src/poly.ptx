      Most people are fairly familiar with polynomials by the time they begin to study abstract algebra.
      When we examine polynomial expressions such as

        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = x^3 -3x +2</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = 3x^2 -6x +5</mrow>
      </md>,
      we have a pretty good idea of what
      <m>p(x) + q(x)</m> and <m>p(x) q(x)</m> mean.
      We just add and multiply polynomials as functions; that is,
      <md permid="rjv">
        <mrow>(p +q)(x) &amp; = p(x) + q(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; =  ( x^3 - 3 x + 2 ) + ( 3 x^2 - 6 x + 5 )</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = x^3 + 3 x^2 - 9 x + 7</mrow>

      It is probably no surprise that polynomials form a ring.
      In this chapter we shall emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials by studying polynomial rings.
      We can prove many results for polynomial rings that are similar to the theorems we proved for the integers.
      Analogs of prime numbers,
      the division algorithm, and the Euclidean algorithm exist for polynomials.

  <title>The Integers</title>

    <p permid="rYD">
      Before we consider a theory of polynomials, we will consider some basic properties of a very familiar ring: the integers.  We have seen that <m>\Z</m> is an integral domain.  The rings of polynomials we will consider will also be integral domains.  A theme for this chapter is that many of the properties of the integers can be generalized to polynomials.  But first, we need to consider what those properties are.
    </p>

    <p permid="YfM">
      We begin with the question of division.  Since <m>\Z</m> is not a field, not every element has a multiplicative inverse (in fact, only <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m> do).  But sometimes, we can still divide.  Can we always?  In a sense, yes!

            This is a perfect example of the existence-and-uniqueness type of proof.
            We must first prove that the numbers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> actually exist.
            Then we must show that if <m>q'</m> and <m>r'</m> are two other such numbers,

            If <m>0 \in S</m>, then <m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>,
            and  we can let <m>q = a/b</m> and <m>r = 0</m>.
            If <m>0 \notin S</m>, we can use the Well-Ordering Principle.
            We must first show that <m>S</m> is nonempty.
            If <m>a \gt 0</m>, then <m>a - b \cdot 0 \in S</m>.
            If <m>a \lt 0</m>, then <m>a - b(2a) = a(1 - 2b) \in S</m>.
            In either case <m>S \neq \emptyset</m>.
            By the Well-Ordering Principle,
          <m>S</m> must have a smallest member, say <m>r = a - bq</m>.
            Therefore, <m>a = bq + r</m>,          <m>r \geq 0</m>.
            We now show that <m>r \lt b</m>.

            In this case we would have <m>a - b(q + 1)</m> in the set <m>S</m>.
            But then <m>a - b(q + 1) \lt a - bq</m>,
            which would contradict the fact that

            From the last equation we have <m>b(q - q') = r' - r</m>;

    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-integers-gcd" permid="Uqu">
      <p permid="jGJ">
          Let us compute the greatest common divisor of <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>.
          First observe that
        <md permid="hay">
          <mrow>2415 &amp; = 945 \cdot 2 + 525</mrow>
          <mrow>945 &amp; = 525 \cdot 1 + 420</mrow>
          <mrow>525 &amp; = 420 \cdot 1 + 105</mrow>
          <mrow>420 &amp; = 105 \cdot 4 + 0</mrow>
        </md>.
          Reversing our steps, <m>105</m> divides <m>420</m>,
        <m>105</m> divides <m>525</m>,
        <m>105</m> divides <m>945</m>,
          and <m>105</m> divides <m>2415</m>.
          Hence, <m>105</m> divides both <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>.
          If <m>d</m> were another common divisor of <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>,
          then <m>d</m> would also have to divide <m>105</m>.
          Therefore, <m>\gcd( 945, 2415 ) = 105</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="PNS">
          If we work backward through the above sequence of equations,
          we can also obtain numbers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>945 r + 2415 s = 105</m>.
          Observe that

          <mrow>&amp; = 2 \cdot 2415 + (-5) \cdot 945</mrow>
        </md>.
          So <m>r = -5</m> and <m>s= 2</m>.
          Notice that <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are not unique,
          since <m>r = 41</m> and <m>s = -16</m> would also work.

    </example>

    <p permid="SmZ">
        To compute <m>\gcd(a,b) = d</m>,

        To find <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>ar + bs = d</m>,

            In this case, <m>p_i</m> must divide
          <m>P - p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n = 1</m>, which is a contradiction.
            Hence, either <m>P</m> is prime or there exists an additional prime number

  <title>Historical Note</title>
  <p permid="eBr">
        Prime numbers were first studied by the ancient Greeks.
        Two important results from antiquity are Euclid's proof that an infinite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes,
        a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positive integer <m>n</m>.
        One problem in number theory is to find a function <m>f</m> such that <m>f(n)</m> is prime for each integer <m>n</m>.
        Pierre Fermat (1601?<ndash/>
1665) conjectured that
  <m>2^{2^n} + 1</m> was prime for all <m>n</m>,
        but later it was shown by Leonhard Euler (1707<ndash/>
1783) that
<me permid="WBt">
          2^{2^5} + 1 = 4{,}294{,}967{,}297
</me>
        is a composite number.
        One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is Goldbach's Conjecture.
        In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjecture that every even integer with the exception of <m>2</m> seemed to be the sum of two primes:
<m>4 = 2 + 2</m>,<m>6 = 3 + 3</m>,
<m>8 =3 + 5</m>,<m>\ldots</m>.
        Although the conjecture has been verified for the numbers up through <m>4 \times 10^{18}</m>,
        it has yet to be proven in general.
        Since prime numbers play an important role in public key cryptography,
        there is currently a great deal of interest in determining whether or not a large number is prime.

        <description>ring of polynomials over a ring <m>R</m></description>
      </notation>

      Two polynomials are equal exactly when their corresponding coefficients are equal; that is,
      if we let
      <md permid="PMf">
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m</mrow>
      </md>,
      then <m>p(x) = q(x)</m> if and only if
      <m>a_i = b_i</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="ueb">
      To show that the set of all polynomials forms a ring,
      we must first define addition and multiplication.
      We define the sum of two polynomials as follows.
      Let
      <md permid="ooP">
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m</mrow>
      </md>.
      Then the sum of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is
      <me permid="vTo">
        p(x) + q(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_k x^k
      </me>,
      where <m>c_i = a_i + b_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
      We define the product of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> to be
      <me permid="cax">
        p(x) q(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_{m + n} x^{m + n}
      </me>,
      where
      <me permid="IhG">
        c_i = \sum_{k = 0}^i a_k b_{i - k} = a_0  b_i + a_1 b_{i -1} + \cdots + a_{i -1} b _1 + a_i b_0
      </me>
      for each <m>i</m>.
      Notice that in each case some of the coefficients may be zero.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-poly-operations" permid="YvK">
      <p permid="hBo">
        Suppose that
        <me permid="UvY">
          p(x) = 3 + 0 x + 0 x^2 + 2 x^3 + 0 x^4
        </me>
        and
        <me permid="ADh">
          q(x) = 2 + 0 x - x^2 + 0 x^3 + 4 x^4
        </me>
        are polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>.
        If the coefficient of some term in a polynomial is zero,
        then we usually just omit that term.
        In this case we  would write
        <m>p(x) =  3 + 2 x^3</m> and <m>q(x) = 2 - x^2 + 4 x^4</m>.
        The sum of these two polynomials is
        <me permid="gKq">
          p(x) + q(x)= 5 - x^2 + 2 x^3 + 4 x^4
        </me>.
        The product,
        <me permid="MRz">
          p(x) q(x) = (3 + 2 x^3)( 2 - x^2 + 4 x^4 ) =  6 - 3x^2 + 4 x^3 + 12 x^4  - 2 x^5 + 8 x^7
        </me>,
        can be calculated either by determining the <m>c_i</m>s in the definition or by simply multiplying polynomials in the same way as we have always done.

        be polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}[x]</m>.
        The sum of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is <m>7 + 4 x^2 + 3 x^3 + 4 x^4</m>.
        The product of the two polynomials is  the zero polynomial.
        This example tells us that we can not expect <m>R[x]</m> to be an integral domain if <m>R</m> is not an integral domain.

        <p permid="UDc">
          Our first task is to show that <m>R[x]</m> is an abelian group under polynomial addition.
          The zero polynomial, <m>f(x) = 0</m>, is the additive identity.
          Given a polynomial <m>p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i x^i</m>,
          the inverse of <m>p(x)</m> is easily verified to be <m>-p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} (-a_i) x^i = -\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i x^i</m>.
          Commutativity and associativity follow immediately from the definition of polynomial addition and from the fact that addition in <m>R</m> is both commutative and associative.

      Recall that the division algorithm for integers (<xref ref="theorem-integers-division_algorithm"/>) says that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers with <m>b \gt 0</m>,
      then there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>a = bq + r</m>,
      where <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m>.
      The algorithm by which <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> are found is just long division.
      A similar theorem exists for polynomials.
      The division algorithm for polynomials has several important consequences.
      Since its proof is very similar to the corresponding proof for integers,
      it is worthwhile to review <xref ref="theorem-integers-division_algorithm"/> at this point.

          We can write <m>d(x) = r(x) p(x) + s(x) q(x)</m> for two polynomials  <m>r(x)</m> and <m>s(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
          We need to show that <m>d(x)</m> divides both <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.
          We shall first show that <m>d(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>.
          By the division algorithm,

          where <m>b(x)</m> is either the zero polynomial or <m>\deg b(x) \lt \deg d(x)</m>.

          consequently, <m>d(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>.
          A symmetric argument shows that <m>d(x)</m> must also divide <m>q(x)</m>;
          hence, <m>d(x)</m> is a common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.

          We will show that <m>d'(x) \mid d(x)</m>.

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p permid="vju">
        Throughout history,
        the solution of polynomial equations has been a challenging problem.
        The Babylonians knew how to solve the equation <m>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</m>.
        Omar Khayyam (1048<ndash/>1131) devised methods of solving cubic equations through the use of geometric constructions and conic sections.
        The algebraic solution of the general cubic equation
        <m>ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0</m> was not discovered until the sixteenth century.
        An Italian mathematician, Luca Pacioli (ca. 1445<ndash/>1509),
        wrote in <pubtitle>Summa de Arithmetica</pubtitle> that the solution of the cubic was impossible.
        This was taken as a challenge by the rest of the mathematical community.
      </p>
            <!-- % 2010/11/1 T Judson Spelling corrected Luca Pacioli (Thanks to Roberto Derenzi) -->
      <p permid="bqD">
        Scipione del Ferro
            <idx><h>Ferro, Scipione del</h></idx>
        (1465<ndash/>1526), of the University of Bologna,
        solved the <q>depressed cubic,</q>
        <me permid="qNW">
          ax^3 + cx + d = 0
        </me>.
        He kept his solution an absolute secret.
        This may seem surprising today,
        when mathematicians are usually very eager to publish their results,
        but in the days of the Italian Renaissance secrecy was customary.
        Academic appointments were not easy to secure and depended on the ability to prevail in public contests.
        Such challenges could be issued at any time.
        Consequently,
        any major new discovery was a valuable weapon in such a contest.
        If an opponent presented a list of problems to be solved,
        del Ferro could in turn present a list of depressed cubics.
        He kept the secret of his discovery throughout his life,
        passing it on only on his deathbed to his student Antonio Fior
            <idx><h>Fior, Antonio</h></idx>
        (ca. 1506<ndash/>?).
      </p>

      <p permid="HxM">
        Although Fior was not the equal of his teacher,
        he immediately issued a challenge to Niccolo Fontana (1499<ndash/>1557).
        Fontana was known as Tartaglia
            <idx><h>Tartaglia</h></idx>
        (the Stammerer).
        As a youth he had suffered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village.
        He survived the savage wound,
        but his speech was permanently impaired.
        Tartaglia sent Fior a list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of 30 depressed cubics.
        Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail.
        After much effort Tartaglia finally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated Fior,
        who faded into obscurity.
      </p>

      <p permid="nEV">
        At this point another mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano
            <idx><h>Cardano, Gerolamo</h></idx>
        (1501<ndash/>1576), entered the story.
        Cardano wrote to Tartaglia,
        begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic.
        Tartaglia refused several of his requests,
        then finally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter swore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else.
        Using the knowledge that he had obtained from Tartaglia, Cardano eventually solved the general cubic
        <me permid="WVf">
          a x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0
        </me>.
        Cardano shared the secret with his student, Ludovico Ferrari
            <idx><h>Ferrari, Ludovico</h></idx>
        (1522<ndash/>1565), who solved the general quartic equation,
        <me permid="Dco">
          a x^4 + b x^3 + cx^2 + d x + e = 0
        </me>.
        In 1543, Cardano and Ferrari examined del Ferro's papers and discovered that he had also solved the depressed cubic.
        Cardano felt that this relieved him of his obligation to Tartaglia,
        so he proceeded to publish the solutions in <pubtitle>Ars Magna</pubtitle> (1545),
        in which he gave credit to del Ferro for solving the special case of the cubic.
        This resulted in a bitter dispute between Cardano and Tartaglia,
        who published the story of the oath a year later.

      <title>Factoring With and Without Complex Numbers</title>

        <p permid="VVa">
          Every odd degree polynomial has a root in <m>\R</m> (how do we know?), so no odd degree polynomial (of degree at least 3) can be irreducible over <m>\R</m>.  What about even degree polynomials?  For example, what about <m>x^2 + 3</m>?  
        </p>

        <p permid="Ccj">
          Well, that polynomial has roots, but they are complex roots, in particular, non-real complex roots.
        </p>

        <p permid="ijs">
          Let's see how to factor in the complex numbers.  It turns out (although hard to prove) that over <m>\C</m>, every polynomial factors into linear terms.  The  <em>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</em> says: Every non-constant polynomial in <m>\mathbb C[x]</m> has a complex root.
        </p>

        <p permid="OqB">
            What does this tell us about the irreducible polynomials in <m>\C[x]</m>? They are exactly the degree 1 polynomials. If <m>a(x)</m> is a polynomial for degree greater than 1 in <m>\C[x]</m>, then it must have a complex root <m>c</m>, so <m>x-c</m> is a factor. Applying this repeatedly, we find <me permid="QfO">a(x) = k(x-c_1)(x-c_2)\cdots(x-c_n)</me>. There will be exactly <m>n</m> roots (although note that the roots might not be distinct).
         </p>
          <p permid="uxK">
            What about simple polynomials like <m>x^5 - 1</m>.  Okay, that is not irreducible, since 1 is a root.  Does it have any other roots?
          </p>
          
          <example permid="Ojk">
            <statement>
              <p permid="TvT">
                Factor <m>x^5-1</m>.  
              </p>
            </statement>
            <solution permid="EtZ">
              <p permid="mEQ">
                We write <m>x^5 = 1</m>.  There are lots of ways to write 1 as a complex number though: <m>1 = e^0 = e^{i2\pi} = e^{i4\pi} = e^{i6\pi} = e^{i8\pi}</m> and so on.  However, we can stop there since we are taking 5th roots.
              </p>
              <p permid="SLZ">
                Now if <m>x^5 = e^{i2\pi}</m>, then <m>x = (x^{5})^\frac{1}{5} = e^{i2\pi/5}</m>.
              </p>

              <p permid="yTi">
                On the other hand, <m>x^5 = e^{i4\pi}</m>, so this says that <m>x = e^{i4\pi/5}</m>.  This is a different complex number than <m>e^{i2\pi/5}</m>, since it has a different angle.
              </p>

              <p permid="far">
                If we do this for each of the five representations of 1, we get the following five fifth-roots of 1:
                <me permid="wmX">
                  1 = e^{i0\pi/5}, ~~ e^{i2\pi/5}, ~~ e^{i4\pi/5}, ~~ e^{i6\pi/5}, ~~ e^{i8\pi/5}
                </me>.
                Note that while <m>e^{i10\pi/5}</m> is also a solution to the equation, this is already listed: <m>e^{i10\pi/5} = e^{i2\pi} = e^0 = 1</m>.  Similarly, <m>e^{i12\pi/5} = e^{i2\pi/5}</m>, and so on.
              </p>

              <p permid="LhA">
                If we plot these five complex numbers we will get five equally spaced points on the unit circle.  Notice that if we raise each to a power we jump around the circle, landing on the point at <m>(1,0)</m> on the fifth power, as expected.
              </p>

            <p permid="aET">
              The example above is perhaps a little simplistic.  In particular, <m>r = 1</m> here, so we didn't need to do anything with that.  In general, if we had <m>re^{i\theta}</m> and took the <m>n</m>th root, we would get <m>\sqrt[n]{r}e^{i\theta/n}</m>.

                  This is different from the previous example for two reasons: we will have an <m>r \ne 1</m>, and we will be finding roots of a negative number.

                <p permid="XvS">
                  Write <m>x^3 = -5 = 5e^{i\pi} = 5e^{i3\pi} = 5e^{i5\pi}</m>.  Then take third roots: <m>x = \sqrt[3]{5}e^{i\pi/3}</m> and <m>x = \sqrt[3]{5}e^{i3\pi/3}</m> and <m>x = \sqrt[3]{5}e^{i5\pi/3}</m>.

                <p permid="jKk">
                  This says that <m>x^3 + 5 = (x+\sqrt[3]{5})(x - \sqrt[3]{5}e^{i\pi/3})(x-\sqrt[3]{5}e^{i5\pi/3})</m>.  As expected, we can factor the polynomial into linear factors over <m>\C</m>.

            </example>

              <p permid="GMc">
                Could we factor the polynomial <m>x^3+5</m> over <m>\R</m>?  We could simply use long division to factor out <m>x+\sqrt[3]{5}</m>, although that might be messy.  Notice though that if we did, then the quotient will be a degree 2 polynomial with real coefficients.
              </p>

              <p permid="mTl">
                There is a better way.  We should be able to get the same polynomial by multiplying the two complex factors from the example above.

                <p permid="PRt">
                  Pick up where we left off when factoring of <m>\C</m>.  Then multiply the two factors corresponding to the complex conjugate roots.
                  We find <me permid="cug">(x-\sqrt[3]{5}e^{i\pi/3})(x-\sqrt[3]{5}e^{i5\pi/3}) - x^2 -\sqrt[3]{5}e^{i5\pi/3}x - \sqrt[3]{5}e^{i\pi/3}x + \sqrt[3]{5}^2e^{i6\pi/3}</me>.
                  The last term is just <m>\sqrt[3]{5}^2</m>.  This makes sense if you think about adding the angles.

                <p permid="vYC">
                  What should be do with the middle terms?  If we write these using trig functions we can see how to add them.  Or use parallelograms.

					Will something like this always work? If <m>a+bi</m> is a root of <m>a(x)</m>, then <m>a-bi</m> is also a root of <m>a(x)</m> (in <m>\C</m>). That is, if <m>r</m> is a root, so is its complex conjugate <m>\overline r</m> is as well.
              </p>

              <p permid="zhD">
					How do we know? Well the function <m>f(r) = \overline r</m> is a ring homomorphism from <m>\mathbb C\to \mathbb C</m>. Check this. But then if <m>a(r) = 0</m>, apply <m>f</m> to both sides to get <m>a(\overline r) = 0</m>.
              </p>

              <p permid="foM">
					This is great: if <m>x-r</m> is a factor of <m>a(x)</m> in <m>\mathbb C[x]</m>, then so is <m>x-\overline r</m>. But notice: <me permid="IBp">(x-r)(x-\overline r) = x^2 - 2ax + (a^2 + b^2)</me> is a quadratic polynomial with <em>real</em> coefficients.
              </p>

              <p permid="LvV">
					This shows that every polynomial in <m>\mathbb R[x]</m> can be factored into polynomials of degree 1 or 2 in <m>\mathbb R[x]</m>.
              </p>

              <p permid="rDe">
