      Most people are fairly familiar with polynomials by the time they begin to study abstract algebra.
      When we examine polynomial expressions such as
      <md permid="Lcm">
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = x^3 -3x +2</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = 3x^2 -6x +5</mrow>
      </md>,
      we have a pretty good idea of what
      <m>p(x) + q(x)</m> and <m>p(x) q(x)</m> mean.
      We just add and multiply polynomials as functions; that is,
      <md permid="rjv">
        <mrow>(p +q)(x) &amp; = p(x) + q(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; =  ( x^3 - 3 x + 2 ) + ( 3 x^2 - 6 x + 5 )</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = x^3 + 3 x^2 - 9 x + 7</mrow>

      It is probably no surprise that polynomials form a ring.
      In this chapter we shall emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials by studying polynomial rings.
      We can prove many results for polynomial rings that are similar to the theorems we proved for the integers.
      Analogs of prime numbers,
      the division algorithm, and the Euclidean algorithm exist for polynomials.

  <title>The Integers</title>

    <p>
      Before we consider a theory of polynomials, we will consider some basic properties of a very familiar ring: the integers.  We have seen that <m>\Z</m> is an integral domain.  The rings of polynomials we will consider will also be integral domains.  A theme for this chapter is that many of the properties of the integers can be generalized to polynomials.  But first, we need to consider what those properties are.
    </p>

    <p>
      We begin with the question of division.  Since <m>\Z</m> is not a field, not every element has a multiplicative inverse (in fact, only <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m> do).  But sometimes, we can still divide.  Can we always?  In a sense, yes!

            This is a perfect example of the existence-and-uniqueness type of proof.
            We must first prove that the numbers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> actually exist.
            Then we must show that if <m>q'</m> and <m>r'</m> are two other such numbers,

            If <m>0 \in S</m>, then <m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>,
            and  we can let <m>q = a/b</m> and <m>r = 0</m>.
            If <m>0 \notin S</m>, we can use the Well-Ordering Principle.
            We must first show that <m>S</m> is nonempty.
            If <m>a \gt 0</m>, then <m>a - b \cdot 0 \in S</m>.
            If <m>a \lt 0</m>, then <m>a - b(2a) = a(1 - 2b) \in S</m>.
            In either case <m>S \neq \emptyset</m>.
            By the Well-Ordering Principle,

            Therefore, <m>a = bq + r</m>,          <m>r \geq 0</m>.
            We now show that <m>r \lt b</m>.

            In this case we would have <m>a - b(q + 1)</m> in the set <m>S</m>.
            But then <m>a - b(q + 1) \lt a - bq</m>,
            which would contradict the fact that

    <example xml:id="example-integers-gcd" permid="Uqu">
      <p permid="jGJ">
          Let us compute the greatest common divisor of <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>.
          First observe that
        <md permid="hay">
          <mrow>2415 &amp; = 945 \cdot 2 + 525</mrow>
          <mrow>945 &amp; = 525 \cdot 1 + 420</mrow>

          <mrow>420 &amp; = 105 \cdot 4 + 0</mrow>
        </md>.
          Reversing our steps, <m>105</m> divides <m>420</m>,
        <m>105</m> divides <m>525</m>,
        <m>105</m> divides <m>945</m>,
          and <m>105</m> divides <m>2415</m>.
          Hence, <m>105</m> divides both <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>.
          If <m>d</m> were another common divisor of <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>,
          then <m>d</m> would also have to divide <m>105</m>.
          Therefore, <m>\gcd( 945, 2415 ) = 105</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="PNS">
          If we work backward through the above sequence of equations,
          we can also obtain numbers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>945 r + 2415 s = 105</m>.
          Observe that

        </md>.
          So <m>r = -5</m> and <m>s= 2</m>.
          Notice that <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are not unique,
          since <m>r = 41</m> and <m>s = -16</m> would also work.

        To compute <m>\gcd(a,b) = d</m>,

            In this case, <m>p_i</m> must divide
          <m>P - p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n = 1</m>, which is a contradiction.
            Hence, either <m>P</m> is prime or there exists an additional prime number

  <title>Historical Note</title>
  <p permid="eBr">
        Prime numbers were first studied by the ancient Greeks.
        Two important results from antiquity are Euclid's proof that an infinite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes,
        a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positive integer <m>n</m>.
        One problem in number theory is to find a function <m>f</m> such that <m>f(n)</m> is prime for each integer <m>n</m>.
        Pierre Fermat (1601?<ndash/>
1665) conjectured that
  <m>2^{2^n} + 1</m> was prime for all <m>n</m>,
        but later it was shown by Leonhard Euler (1707<ndash/>
1783) that
<me permid="WBt">
          2^{2^5} + 1 = 4{,}294{,}967{,}297
</me>
        is a composite number.
        One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is Goldbach's Conjecture.
        In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjecture that every even integer with the exception of <m>2</m> seemed to be the sum of two primes:
<m>4 = 2 + 2</m>,<m>6 = 3 + 3</m>,
<m>8 =3 + 5</m>,<m>\ldots</m>.
        Although the conjecture has been verified for the numbers up through <m>4 \times 10^{18}</m>,
        it has yet to be proven in general.
        Since prime numbers play an important role in public key cryptography,
        there is currently a great deal of interest in determining whether or not a large number is prime.

    <title>The Division Algorithm</title>

      Recall that the division algorithm for integers (<xref ref="theorem-integers-division_algorithm"/>) says that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers with <m>b \gt 0</m>,
      then there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>a = bq + r</m>,
      where <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m>.
      The algorithm by which <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> are found is just long division.
      A similar theorem exists for polynomials.
      The division algorithm for polynomials has several important consequences.
      Since its proof is very similar to the corresponding proof for integers,
      it is worthwhile to review <xref ref="theorem-integers-division_algorithm"/> at this point.

          We can write <m>d(x) = r(x) p(x) + s(x) q(x)</m> for two polynomials  <m>r(x)</m> and <m>s(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m>.
          We need to show that <m>d(x)</m> divides both <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.
          We shall first show that <m>d(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>.
          By the division algorithm,
          there exist polynomials <m>a(x)</m> and <m>b(x)</m> such that <m>p(x) = a(x) d(x) + b(x)</m>,
          where <m>b(x)</m> is either the zero polynomial or <m>\deg b(x) \lt \deg d(x)</m>.

          However, <m>b(x)</m> must be the zero polynomial since <m>d(x)</m> was chosen to be of smallest degree;
          consequently, <m>d(x)</m> divides <m>p(x)</m>.
          A symmetric argument shows that <m>d(x)</m> must also divide <m>q(x)</m>;
          hence, <m>d(x)</m> is a common divisor of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.

          We will show that <m>d'(x) \mid d(x)</m>.

            Note that if the ideal contains these polynomials then it also contains <m>2x^7 + 2</m> and thus also <m>2x^7 + 4 - (2x^7 + 2) = 2</m>, and then also 1 (since <m>2\cdot 3 \in J</m> too).  Thus <m>J = \langle 1 \rangle = \Z_5[x]</m>.

            By the division algorithm, <m>a(x) = q(x)b(x) + r(x)</m>, which in turn means that <m>a(x) - q(x)b(x) = r(x)</m>.  But <m>-q(x)b(x) \ in J</m> (since <m>J</m> absorbs products) and thus so is <m>a(x) - q(x)b(x) = r(x)</m>.

            In the previous problem you proved that if <m>a(x), b(x) \in J</m> and <m>a(x) = q(x)b(x) + r(x)</m>, then <m>r(x) \in J</m>.  If you then apply the division algorithm again, to <m>b(x)</m> and <m>r(x)</m>, to find <m>b(x) = q'(x)r(x) + r'(x)</m>, you would have that <m>r'(x) \in J</m> as well.

            What would happen if you kept doing this?  Would it go on forever?  If it stops, how would it?  And what does this have to do with the GCD?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We know that the process cannot go on forever, since each time the new remainder is smaller than the previous remainder (the new divisor).  Thus eventually this must stop (by having a remainder of zero).
          </p>
          <p>
            The last non-zero remainder will in fact be the greatest common divisor of <m>a(x)</m> and <m>b(x)</m>, since it will be the smallest degree polynomial in the ideal.

            There are no roots.  Since any factorization would need to include a linear term, this says that the polynomial is irreducible.

      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p permid="vju">
        Throughout history,
        the solution of polynomial equations has been a challenging problem.
        The Babylonians knew how to solve the equation <m>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</m>.
        Omar Khayyam (1048<ndash/>1131) devised methods of solving cubic equations through the use of geometric constructions and conic sections.
        The algebraic solution of the general cubic equation
        <m>ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0</m> was not discovered until the sixteenth century.
        An Italian mathematician, Luca Pacioli (ca. 1445<ndash/>1509),
        wrote in <pubtitle>Summa de Arithmetica</pubtitle> that the solution of the cubic was impossible.
        This was taken as a challenge by the rest of the mathematical community.
      </p>
            <!-- % 2010/11/1 T Judson Spelling corrected Luca Pacioli (Thanks to Roberto Derenzi) -->
      <p permid="bqD">
        Scipione del Ferro
            <idx><h>Ferro, Scipione del</h></idx>
        (1465<ndash/>1526), of the University of Bologna,
        solved the <q>depressed cubic,</q>
        <me permid="qNW">
          ax^3 + cx + d = 0
        </me>.
        He kept his solution an absolute secret.
        This may seem surprising today,
        when mathematicians are usually very eager to publish their results,
        but in the days of the Italian Renaissance secrecy was customary.
        Academic appointments were not easy to secure and depended on the ability to prevail in public contests.
        Such challenges could be issued at any time.
        Consequently,
        any major new discovery was a valuable weapon in such a contest.
        If an opponent presented a list of problems to be solved,
        del Ferro could in turn present a list of depressed cubics.
        He kept the secret of his discovery throughout his life,
        passing it on only on his deathbed to his student Antonio Fior
            <idx><h>Fior, Antonio</h></idx>
        (ca. 1506<ndash/>?).
      </p>

      <p permid="HxM">
        Although Fior was not the equal of his teacher,
        he immediately issued a challenge to Niccolo Fontana (1499<ndash/>1557).
        Fontana was known as Tartaglia
            <idx><h>Tartaglia</h></idx>
        (the Stammerer).
        As a youth he had suffered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village.
        He survived the savage wound,
        but his speech was permanently impaired.
        Tartaglia sent Fior a list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of 30 depressed cubics.
        Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail.
        After much effort Tartaglia finally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated Fior,
        who faded into obscurity.
      </p>

      <p permid="nEV">
        At this point another mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano
            <idx><h>Cardano, Gerolamo</h></idx>
        (1501<ndash/>1576), entered the story.
        Cardano wrote to Tartaglia,
        begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic.
        Tartaglia refused several of his requests,
        then finally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter swore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else.
        Using the knowledge that he had obtained from Tartaglia, Cardano eventually solved the general cubic
        <me permid="WVf">
          a x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0
        </me>.
        Cardano shared the secret with his student, Ludovico Ferrari
            <idx><h>Ferrari, Ludovico</h></idx>
        (1522<ndash/>1565), who solved the general quartic equation,
        <me permid="Dco">
          a x^4 + b x^3 + cx^2 + d x + e = 0
        </me>.
        In 1543, Cardano and Ferrari examined del Ferro's papers and discovered that he had also solved the depressed cubic.
        Cardano felt that this relieved him of his obligation to Tartaglia,
        so he proceeded to publish the solutions in <pubtitle>Ars Magna</pubtitle> (1545),
        in which he gave credit to del Ferro for solving the special case of the cubic.
        This resulted in a bitter dispute between Cardano and Tartaglia,
        who published the story of the oath a year later.

          We have <m>x+2 = (2x+1)(3x+2)</m>.  This is strange.  Under our definition, the polynomial is still irreducible, but it does now factor into polynomials of positive degree (which would be an equivalent definition if the coefficients came from a field).

      <title>Factoring With and Without Complex Numbers</title>

        <p>
          Every odd degree polynomial has a root in <m>\R</m> (how do we know?), so no odd degree polynomial (of degree at least 3) can be irreducible over <m>\R</m>.  What about even degree polynomials?  For example, what about <m>x^2 + 3</m>?  
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, that polynomial has roots, but they are complex roots, in particular, non-real complex roots.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's see how to factor in the complex numbers.  It turns out (although hard to prove) that over <m>\C</m>, every polynomial factors into linear terms.  The  <em>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</em> says: Every non-constant polynomial in <m>\mathbb C[x]</m> has a complex root.
        </p>

        <p>
            What does this tell us about the irreducible polynomials in <m>\C[x]</m>? They are exactly the degree 1 polynomials. If <m>a(x)</m> is a polynomial for degree greater than 1 in <m>\C[x]</m>, then it must have a complex root <m>c</m>, so <m>x-c</m> is a factor. Applying this repeatedly, we find <me>a(x) = k(x-c_1)(x-c_2)\cdots(x-c_n)</me>. There will be exactly <m>n</m> roots (although note that the roots might not be distinct).
         </p>
          <p>
            What about simple polynomials like <m>x^5 - 1</m>.  Okay, that is not irreducible, since 1 is a root.  Does it have any other roots?

            <statement>
              <p>
                Factor <m>x^5-1</m>.  
              </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                We write <m>x^5 = 1</m>.  There are lots of ways to write 1 as a complex number though: <m>1 = e^0 = e^{i2\pi} = e^{i4\pi} = e^{i6\pi} = e^{i8\pi}</m> and so on.  However, we can stop there since we are taking 5th roots.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now if <m>x^5 = e^{i2\pi}</m>, then <m>x = (x^{5})^\frac{1}{5} = e^{i2\pi/5}</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the other hand, <m>x^5 = e^{i4\pi}</m>, so this says that <m>x = e^{i4\pi/5}</m>.  This is a different complex number than <m>e^{i2\pi/5}</m>, since it has a different angle.
              </p>

              <p>
                If we do this for each of the five representations of 1, we get the following five fifth-roots of 1:
                <me>
                  1 = e^{i0\pi/5}, ~~ e^{i2\pi/5}, ~~ e^{i4\pi/5}, ~~ e^{i6\pi/5}, ~~ e^{i8\pi/5}
                </me>.
                Note that while <m>e^{i10\pi/5}</m> is also a solution to the equation, this is already listed: <m>e^{i10\pi/5} = e^{i2\pi} = e^0 = 1</m>.  Similarly, <m>e^{i12\pi/5} = e^{i2\pi/5}</m>, and so on.
              </p>

              <p>
                If we plot these five complex numbers we will get five equally spaced points on the unit circle.  Notice that if we raise each to a power we jump around the circle, landing on the point at <m>(1,0)</m> on the fifth power, as expected.
              </p>

            </solution>
          </example>
              
            <p>
              The example above is perhaps a little simplistic.  In particular, <m>r = 1</m> here, so we didn't need to do anything with that.  In general, if we had <m>re^{i\theta}</m> and took the <m>n</m>th root, we would get <m>\sqrt[n]{r}e^{i\theta/n}</m>.  
              </p>

            <example>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Factor <m>x^3 + 5</m> over the complex numbers.
                </p>
              </statement>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  This is different from the previous example for two reasons: we will have an <m>r \ne 1</m>, and we will be finding roots of a negative number.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Write <m>x^3 = -5 = 5e^{i\pi} = 5e^{i3\pi} = 5e^{i5\pi}</m>.  Then take third roots: <m>x = \sqrt[3]{5}e^{i\pi/3}</m> and <m>x = \sqrt[3]{5}e^{i3\pi/3}</m> and <m>x = \sqrt[3]{5}e^{i5\pi/3}</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Plot these three points on the complex plane.  One will be on the negative real axis (<m>x</m>-axis), the other two will be vertically aligned in the first and fourth quadrants.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This says that <m>x^3 + 5 = (x+\sqrt[3]{5})(x - \sqrt[3]{5}e^{i\pi/3})(x-\sqrt[3]{5}e^{i5\pi/3})</m>.  As expected, we can factor the polynomial into linear factors over <m>\C</m>.
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>

              <p>
                Could we factor the polynomial <m>x^3+5</m> over <m>\R</m>?  We could simply use long division to factor out <m>x+\sqrt[3]{5}</m>, although that might be messy.  Notice though that if we did, then the quotient will be a degree 2 polynomial with real coefficients.
              </p>

              <p>
                There is a better way.  We should be able to get the same polynomial by multiplying the two complex factors from the example above.
              </p>
            <example>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Factor <m>x^3+5</m> over the real numbers.
                </p>
              </statement>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  Pick up where we left off when factoring of <m>\C</m>.  Then multiply the two factors corresponding to the complex conjugate roots.
                  We find <me>(x-\sqrt[3]{5}e^{i\pi/3})(x-\sqrt[3]{5}e^{i5\pi/3}) - x^2 -\sqrt[3]{5}e^{i5\pi/3}x - \sqrt[3]{5}e^{i\pi/3}x + \sqrt[3]{5}^2e^{i6\pi/3}</me>.
                  The last term is just <m>\sqrt[3]{5}^2</m>.  This makes sense if you think about adding the angles.
                  
                </p>
                <p>
                  What should be do with the middle terms?  If we write these using trig functions we can see how to add them.  Or use parallelograms.
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>

          <p>
            
					Will something like this always work? If <m>a+bi</m> is a root of <m>a(x)</m>, then <m>a-bi</m> is also a root of <m>a(x)</m> (in <m>\C</m>). That is, if <m>r</m> is a root, so is its complex conjugate <m>\overline r</m> is as well.
              </p>

              <p>
					How do we know? Well the function <m>f(r) = \overline r</m> is a ring homomorphism from <m>\mathbb C\to \mathbb C</m>. Check this. But then if <m>a(r) = 0</m>, apply <m>f</m> to both sides to get <m>a(\overline r) = 0</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
					This is great: if <m>x-r</m> is a factor of <m>a(x)</m> in <m>\mathbb C[x]</m>, then so is <m>x-\overline r</m>. But notice: <me>(x-r)(x-\overline r) = x^2 - 2ax + (a^2 + b^2)</me> is a quadratic polynomial with <em>real</em> coefficients.
              </p>

              <p>
					This shows that every polynomial in <m>\mathbb R[x]</m> can be factored into polynomials of degree 1 or 2 in <m>\mathbb R[x]</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
					Thus the irreducible polynomials in <m>\mathbb R[x]</m> are exactly the linear polynomials and the quadratics with negative discriminant (i.e., <m>b^2 - 4ac \lt 0</m>).
              </p>

              <p>
            Here is another example.  
            </p>
            <example>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Factor <m>p(x) = x^9 - 2x^8 - 3x^7 - 2x^2 + 4x + 6</m> completely over <m>\mathbb Q</m>, <m>\mathbb R</m> and <m>\mathbb C</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>
              <solution>
                <p>
                  Note that the rational roots theorem tells us that the only possible rational roots are <m>\pm 1</m>, <m>\pm 2</m>, <m>\pm 3</m> and <m>\pm 6</m>. Plugging these in, we see quickly that <m>-1</m> and <m>3</m> are roots.
                  
                </p>
                <p>
                  After dividing by <m>(x+1)(x-3)</m> we are left with <m>(x^7 - 2)</m>, which is irreducible over <m>\mathbb Q</m> by Eisenstein. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now let’s work over <m>\mathbb C</m>. We can find the roots of <m>x^7 - 2</m> by writing <m>2 = 2e^{i0} = 2e^{i2\pi} = 2e^{i4\pi} = \cdots = 2e^{i12\pi}</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Taking <m>7</m>th roots: <me>x = \sqrt[7]{2}, x = \sqrt[7]{2}e^{i2\pi/7}, x = \sqrt[7]{2}e^{i4\pi/7}, \ldots, x = \sqrt[7]{2}e^{i12\pi/7}</me>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  This allows us to write down the 9 factors of degree 1 for <m>p(x)</m> over <m>\mathbb C</m>.
                  <me>x^7-2 = (x-\sqrt[7]{2})(x-\sqrt[7]{2}e^{i2\pi/7})(x-\sqrt[7]{2}e^{i4\pi/7})\cdots(x-\sqrt[7]{2}e^{i12\pi/7})
                  </me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, over <m>\mathbb R</m> we can multiply out each pair of complex conjugate factors. To find them, look at the unit circle. This gives: <me>\begin{aligned}
                    p(x)  = (x+1)(x-3)(x-\sqrt[7]{2})&amp;(x^2 - 2^{8/7}\cos(2\pi/7)x + 2^{2/7})\cdot \\ &amp; \cdot(x^2 - 2^{8/7}\cos(4\pi/7)x + 2^{2/7})(x^2 - 2^{8/7}\cos(6\pi/7)x + 2^{2/7})\end{aligned}</me>
                </p>
              </solution>
            </example>

        <statement>
          <p>
          Prove that the function <m>\phi:\bC \to \bC</m> given by <m>\phi(z) = \bar z</m> is a ring homomorphism.  Here <m>\bar z = a-bi</m> is the complex conjugate of <m>z = a+bi</m>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
          Consider the two complex numbers <m>a+bi</m> and <m>c+di</m>.  We have 
            <me>
            \phi(a+bi)+\phi(c+di) = a-bi + c - di = a+c - (b+d)i = \phi(a+c+(b+d)i) = \phi((a+bi)+(c+di))
            </me>
          and

            \phi(a+bi)\phi(c+di) = (a-bi)(c-di) = ac + bd - (cb+ad)i = \phi(ac+bd + (cb+ad)i) = \phi((a+bi)(c+di))

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
          Let <m>z</m> be a complex number.  Prove that the sum <m>z + \bar z</m> and product <m>z\cdot \bar z</m> or the number with its conjugate are always real numbers.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
          For the sum, it is easiest to think of <m>z = a+bi</m>, since now <m>a+bi+a-bi = 2a</m>.  For the product, write the number in polar form: <m>z = re^{i\theta}</m> so <m>\bar z = re^{-i\theta}</m>.  Thus <m>z\cdot\bar z = re^{i\theta}re^{-i\theta} = r^2e^{0} = r^2</m>.

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
          Is <m>x^7 - 1</m> irreducible over <m>\bC</m>?  How many roots should it have?  Find all of them.  Hint: use the polar form of complex numbers, <m>re^{i\vartheta}</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
         The polynomial is not irreducible over <m>\bC</m> because the only irreducible polynomials with real coefficients over <m>\bC</m> are the linear polynomials.  It should have exactly 7 roots.  If we write <m>1 = e^0 = e^{2\pi i} = \cdots</m> and raise each to the <m>1/7</m> we get the roots.  They are:
            <me>e^0 = 1, ~~ e^{\frac{2\pi}{7}i}, ~~ e^{\frac{4\pi}{7}i}, ~~ e^{\frac{6\pi}{7}i}, ~~ e^{\frac{8\pi}{7}i}, ~~ e^{\frac{10\pi}{7}i}, ~~ e^{\frac{12\pi}{7}i}</me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
          Factor <m>x^8 - 5x^7 - 14x^6 + x^2 - 5x - 14</m> completely over <m>\Q</m>,            <m>\bC</m> and <m>\R</m>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
          First, find rational roots.  They are -2 and 7.  Dividing we get
            <me>(x+2)(x-7)(x^6+1)</me>
          The last term has no roots but is still not irreducible.  We can use sum of cubes:
            <me>(x+2)(x-7)(x^2+1)(x^4-x^2 + 1)</me>
          The last degree 4 polynomial is irreducible - use the quadratic formula for <m>x^2</m> to see that there are no quadratic factors over <m>\Q</m>.

          Now let's factor <m>(x^6 + 1)</m> over <m>\bC</m>.  There are 6 roots, namely
            <me>e^{i\pi/6},~~ e^{i3\pi/6}, ~~e^{i5\pi/6},~~ e^{i7\pi/6}, ~~ e^{i9\pi/6}, ~~e^{i11\pi/6}</me>
          These are all <q>nice</q> angles, so it is easy to convert back to rectangular form.  So over <m>\bC</m> we have the factorization
            <me>(x+2)(x-7)(x-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-\frac{1}{2}i)(x-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\frac{1}{2}i)(x-i)(x+i)(x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-\frac{1}{2}i)(x+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\frac{1}{2}i)</me>

          Finally, to get the factorization over <m>\R</m> we multiply conjugate pairs:
            <me>(x+2)(x-7)(x^2+1)(x^2 - \sqrt{3}+1)(x^2 + \sqrt{3}x + 1)</me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>

      <statement>
        <p>
            Find the greatest common divisor of 471 and 564 using the Euclidean Algorithm and then find integers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>\gcd(471,564) = 471r+564s</m>. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
            First we perform the Euclidean algorithm:
          <md>
            <mrow>564 = \amp 1\cdot 471 + 93 </mrow>
            <mrow>471 = \amp 5\cdot 93 + 6 </mrow>
            <mrow>93 = \amp 15\cdot 6 + 3 </mrow>
            <mrow>6 = \amp 2\cdot 3 + 0 </mrow>
          </md>
            so <m>\gcd(471,564) = 3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now working backwards through the lines of the Euclidean algorithm to find <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>3 = \amp 93 - 15\cdot 6</mrow>
            <mrow>3 = \amp 93 - 15\cdot (471 - 5\cdot 93) = -15\cdot 471 + 76\cdot 93</mrow>
            <mrow>3 =  -15\cdot 471 + 76\cdot (564 - 471) = 76\cdot 564 - 91\cdot 471</mrow>
          </md>
            so <m>r = -91</m> and <m>s = 76</m>.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>n = 3</m>, since that is <m>\gcd(471,564)</m>.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
            In the quotient ring <m>\Z/\langle 564 \rangle</m>, find an element <m>a + \langle 564\rangle</m> such that <m>(a+\langle 564\rangle)(471 + \langle 564\rangle) = 3 + \langle 564 \rangle</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Using the work done in question 1 above, we need <m>a = -91</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Why is this?  Well we want <m>(a + \langle 564\rangle)(471 + \langle 564\rangle) = 3+\langle 564\rangle</m>.  In other words, we want <m>a\cdot 471 + \langle 564\rangle = 3 + \langle 564\rangle</m>, which is the same as asking that <m>3 \in a\cdot 471 + \langle 564\rangle</m>.  This is another way of requiring <me>3 = a\cdot 471 + k\cdot 564</me>.  We found values of <m>a</m> and <m>k</m> to make this so above.
        </p>

            Is <m>471 + \langle 564\rangle</m> a unit in <m>\Z/\langle 564\rangle</m>?  Explain.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
            No.  Being a unit means that there is a multiplicative inverse.  That would be a coset <m>a + \langle 564 \rangle</m> that when multiplied by <m>471+\langle 564\rangle</m> gives the unity <m>1+\langle 564\rangle</m>.  We would then have <m>471a = 1 + 564k</m> for some <m>k \in \Z</m>.  But that would imply that <m>\gcd(471, 564) = 1</m>.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
            The gcd is <m>x+1</m>.  Working backwards we get <m>x+1 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + x + 2)a(x) - \frac{1}{2}x b(x)</m>.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
            Let's use the Euclidean algorithm:
          <md>
            <mrow>x^{24} - 1 =  \amp x^9(x^{15} - 1) + x^9 - 1 </mrow>
            <mrow>x^{15} - 1 =  \amp x^6(x^{9} - 1) + x^6 - 1 </mrow>
            <mrow>x^{9} - 1 =  \amp x^3(x^{6} - 1) + x^3 - 1 </mrow>
            <mrow>x^{6} - 1 =  \amp (x^3+1)(x^{3} - 1) + 0 </mrow>
          </md>
            Thus the gcd is <m>x^3-1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now work backwards:
          <md>
            <mrow>x^3 - 1 = \amp [x^9-1] - x^3[x^6-1] </mrow>
            <mrow>x^3 - 1 = \amp [x^9-1] - x^3([x^{15}-1] - x^6[x^9-1]) </mrow>
            <mrow> = \amp -x^3[x^{15}-1] + (x^9+1)[x^9-1] </mrow>
            <mrow>x^3 - 1 = \amp -x^3[x^{15}-1] + (x^9+1)([x^{24} - 1] - x^9[x^{15}-1] ) </mrow>
