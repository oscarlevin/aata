      The following theorem characterizes transcendental extensions.

        <p permid="pdA">
          Let <m>\phi_{\alpha} : F[x] \rightarrow E</m> be the evaluation homomorphism for <m>\alpha</m>.

    <p permid="KTs">
      There are lots of extension fields that contain elements transcendental over the base field.  For example, we could consider <m>\Q(\pi)</m>. It turns out this will be isomorphic to <m>\Q(x)</m>, the field of all rational functions with rational coefficients.  So in some sense, this is not that interesting: no matter what transcendental element you add, you get the same extension field.  We have a more interesting situation in the case of algebraic extensions.

          Let <m>\phi_{\alpha} : F[x] \rightarrow E</m> be the evaluation homomorphism.

          We know that such a polynomial exists,

          The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> consists exactly of those elements of <m>F[x]</m> having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero.

          So <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial of minimal degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero.
          Any other polynomial of the same degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero must have the form

    <p permid="SxR">
      First, if we are start with a given polynomial <m>p(x)</m> over some field <m>F</m>, we know there is some extension field <m>E</m> above <m>F</m> in which <m>p(x)</m> has a root <m>\alpha</m> (and therefore factors).  This is <xref ref="theorem-fundamental-of-field-theory"/>.

      On the other hand, we can start a extension field <m>E</m> of a base field <m>F</m> that contains some element <m>\alpha</m> <em>algebraic</em> over <m>F</m>.

By <xref ref="proposition-minimal-poly"/>, the field extension <m>F(\alpha)</m> (which is a subfield of <m>E</m>, if not <m>E</m> exactly) is isomorphic to the quotient ring <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.

      So if you have a minimal polynomial <m>p(x)</m>, you can find an extension field that contains a root <m>\alpha</m>, namely <m>F[x]/\langle p(x)\rangle</m>.
