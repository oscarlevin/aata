  <title>Extension Fields</title>
  <introduction>
    <p permid="WEx">
      Recall that we say a field <m>E</m> is an <term>extension field</term>
          <idx><h>Extension</h><h>field</h></idx>
          <idx><h>Field</h><h>extension</h></idx>
      of a field <m>F</m> if <m>F</m> is a subfield of <m>E</m>.
      The field <m>F</m> is called the <term>base field</term>.
          <idx><h>Field</h><h>base</h></idx>
      We write <m>F \subset E</m>.  Or goal is to build extension fields so that particular polynomials that were previously irreducible can now be factored in the extension field.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One obvious way to ensure this happens is to include the root of that polynomial in the field.  We previously defined <m>E = \Q(\sqrt{2}) = \{a + b\sqrt{2} \st a, b \in \Q</m> as an extension field of <m>\Q</m>.  In this field, the polynomial <m>x^2 - 2</m> has a root, so can be factored.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In general, given a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m> for some field <m>F</m>, and a root <m>\alpha</m>, we want to build an extension field containing <m>\alpha</m> so that <m>p(x)</m> factors.  We could do the same thing as above, taking <m>F(\alpha)</m>.  That is, add a new element <m>\alpha</m> to <m>F</m> and close the set under addition and multiplication.  The question is, will this always be a field?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our salvation comes from quotient rings.  If it has been a while, you might review <xref ref="section-ring-homomorphisms"/>.  Then try the following activity, which works through the general strategy in the simple example of <m>\alpha = \sqrt{2}</m>.

    <title>Extension Fields and Polynomials</title>
    
    
    
    <p>
      We will often take <m>F = \Q</m>, but of course other fields can be used as well and our strategy of using quotient rings will still work.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-fields-finite-f4" permid="WiL">
      <p permid="UPk">
        Let <m>p(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>.
        Since neither 0 nor 1 is a root of this polynomial,
        we know that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
        We will construct a field extension of
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
        By <xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly"/>,
        the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is maximal;
        hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
        (That modding out by a maximal ideal produces a fields is a result that applies to rings in general, not just polynomial rings; we could have argued that <m>\Z_2[x]/\langle p(x)\rangle</m> is a field using Bezout's identity as well.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x) + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> be an arbitrary element of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
        By the division algorithm,
        <me permid="Oja">
          f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1) q(x) + r(x)
        </me>,
        where the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>.
        Therefore,
        <me permid="uqj">
          f(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle = r(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle
        </me>.
        The only possibilities for <m>r(x)</m> are then <m>0</m>,
        <m>1</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>1 + x</m>.
        Consequently,
        <m>E = {\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field with four elements and must be a field extension of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
        containing a zero <m>\alpha</m> of <m>p(x)</m>.
        The field <m>{\mathbb Z}_2(  \alpha)</m> consists of elements
        <md permid="GEB">
          <mrow>0 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>1 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 1</mrow>
          <mrow>0 + 1 \alpha &amp; = \alpha</mrow>
          <mrow>1 + 1 \alpha &amp; = 1 + \alpha</mrow>
        </md>.
        Notice that <m>{\alpha}^2 + {\alpha} + 1 = 0</m>;
        hence, if we compute <m>(1 + \alpha)^2</m>,
        <me permid="axs">
          (1 + \alpha)(1 + \alpha)= 1 + \alpha + \alpha + (\alpha)^2 = \alpha
        </me>.
        Other calculations are accomplished in a similar manner.
        We summarize these computations in the following tables,
        which tell us how to add and multiply elements in <m>E</m>.

    <p>
      To summarize our strategy: we want to build an extension field of <m>F</m> that contains an element <m>\alpha</m>, presumably not already in <m>F</m>.  As long as <m>\alpha</m> is the root of a polynomial, we can take <m>p(x)</m> to be an irreducible polynomial (over <m>F</m>) that has <m>\alpha</m> as a root, and consider the quotient ring <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.  Using the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem, this quotient ring will be isomorphic to our desired extension field.
    </p>

    <p permid="OZY">
      That is precisely the content of the statement and proof of the following theorem, due to Kronecker.
      The result is so important and so basic to our understanding of fields that it is often known as the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory</em>.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="theorem-fundamental-of-field-theory" permid="lrJ">
      <statement>
        <p permid="ldB">
          Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>p(x)</m> be a nonconstant polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>.
          Then there exists an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> and an element
          <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof permid="fCx">
        <p permid="wHZ">
          We can assume that <m>p(x)</m> is an irreducible polynomial (otherwise, just factor it and work with an irreducible part that has <m>\alpha</m> as a root).
          We wish to find an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
          The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is a maximal ideal in <m>F[x]</m> by <xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly"/>;
          hence, <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
          We claim that <m>E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is the desired field.
        </p>

        <p permid="cPi">
          We first show that <m>E</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.
          We can define a homomorphism of commutative rings by the map <m>\psi:F \rightarrow F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>,
          where <m>\psi(a) = a + \langle p(x)\rangle</m> for <m>a \in F</m>.
          It is easy to check that <m>\psi</m> is indeed a ring homomorphism.
          Observe that
          <me permid="zac">
            \psi( a ) + \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle) + (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = (a + b) + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( a + b )
          </me>
          and
          <me permid="fhl">
            \psi( a ) \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle)  (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = ab + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( ab )
          </me>.
          To prove that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one, assume that
          <me permid="Lou">
            a + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi(a) = \psi(b) = b + \langle p(x) \rangle
          </me>.
          Then <m>a - b</m> is a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>,
          since it lives in the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
          Since <m>p(x)</m> is a nonconstant polynomial,
          the only possibility is that <m>a - b = 0</m>.
          Consequently, <m>a = b</m> and <m>\psi</m> is injective.
          Since <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one,
          we can identify <m>F</m> with the subfield
          <m>\{ a + \langle p(x) \rangle : a \in F \}</m> of <m>E</m> and view <m>E</m> as an extension field of <m>F</m>.
        </p>
          <!-- \alpha is in E not F - TWJ 4/23/2011 -->
        <p permid="IWr">
          It remains for us to prove that <m>p(x)</m> has a zero <m>\alpha \in E</m>.
          Set <m>\alpha = x + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
          Then <m>\alpha</m> is in <m>E</m>.
          If <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</m>, then
          <md permid="rvD">
            <mrow>p( \alpha ) &amp; =  a_0 + a_1( x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + a_n ( x + \langle p(x) \rangle)^n</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + ( a_1 x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + (a_n  x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle)</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = 0 + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
          </md>.
          Therefore, we have found an element
          <m>\alpha \in E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> such that <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>p(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>

        Let <m>p(x) = x^5 + x^4 + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>.

        For a field extension <m>E</m> of

        we can let <m>E</m> be either
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> or <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle</m>.
        We will leave it as an exercise to show that
