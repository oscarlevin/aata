  <title>The Sylow Theorems</title>

    <p permid="Ejh">
      We already know that the converse of Lagrange's Theorem is false.
      If <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> divides <m>m</m>,
      then <m>G</m> does not necessarily possess a subgroup of order <m>n</m>.
      For example,
      <m>A_4</m> has order <m>12</m> but does not possess a subgroup of order <m>6</m>.
      However, the Sylow Theorems do provide a partial converse for Lagrange's Theorem<mdash/>in certain cases they guarantee us subgroups of specific orders.
      These theorems yield a powerful set of tools for the classification of all finite nonabelian groups.

    <title>The Sylow Theorems</title>
    <introduction permid="Nad">
      <p permid="kqq">
        We will use what we have learned about group actions to prove the Sylow Theorems.
        Recall for a moment what it means for <m>G</m> to act on itself by conjugation and how conjugacy classes are distributed in the group according to the class equation,
        discussed in <xref ref="actions"/>.
        A group  <m>G</m> acts on itself by conjugation via the map <m>(g,x) \mapsto gxg^{-1}</m>.
        Let <m>x_1, \ldots,
        x_k</m> be representatives from each  of the distinct conjugacy classes of <m>G</m> that consist of more than one element.
        Then the class equation can be written as
        <me permid="OWH">
          |G| = |Z(G)| + [G: C(x_1) ] + \cdots + [ G: C(x_k)]
        </me>,
        where <m>Z(G) = \{g \in G : gx = xg \text{ for all } x \in G\}</m> is the center of <m>G</m> and 
        <m>C(x_i) = \{ g \in G : g x_i = x_i g \}</m> is the centralizer subgroup of <m>x_i</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="Qxz">
        We begin our investigation of the Sylow Theorems by examining subgroups of order <m>p</m>,
        where <m>p</m> is prime.
        A group <m>G</m> is a <term><m>p</m>-group</term>
            <idx><h>Group</h><h><m>p</m>-group</h></idx>
        if every element in <m>G</m> has as its order a power of <m>p</m>,
        where <m>p</m> is a prime number.
        A subgroup of a group <m>G</m> is a
        <term><m>p</m>-subgroup</term><idx><h>Subgroup!<m>p</m>-subgroup</h></idx> if it is a <m>p</m>-group.

        <proof permid="Zov">
          <p permid="LdM">
            We will use induction on the order of <m>G</m>.
            If <m>|G|=p</m>,
            then clearly <m>G</m> itself is the required subgroup.
            We now assume that every group of order <m>k</m>,
            where <m>p \leq k \lt n</m> and <m>p</m> divides <m>k</m>,
            has an element of order <m>p</m>.
            Assume that <m>|G|= n</m> and
            <m>p \mid n</m> and consider the class equation of <m>G</m>:
            <me permid="vdQ">

            We have two cases.

          <case>
            <title>Case 1</title>
            <p permid="rkV">
              Suppose the order of one of the centralizer subgroups,

              is divisible by <m>p</m> for some <m>i</m>, <m>i = 1, \ldots, k</m>.
              In this case, by our induction hypothesis, we are done.
              Since <m>C(x_i)</m> is a proper subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>p</m> divides <m>|C(x_i)|</m>,
              <m>C(x_i)</m> must contain an element of order <m>p</m>.

              the order of each conjugacy class in the class equation;

              Since <m>Z(G)</m> is abelian,
              it must have a subgroup of order <m>p</m> by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.
              Therefore, the center of <m>G</m> contains an element of order <m>p</m>.

          Let us consider the group <m>A_5</m>.

          By Cauchy's Theorem,
          we are guaranteed that <m>A_5</m> has subgroups of orders <m>2</m>,

          The Sylow Theorems will give us even more information about the possible subgroups of <m>A_5</m>.

      </example>

      <p permid="wEI">
        We are now ready to state and prove the first of the Sylow Theorems.
        The proof is very similar to the proof of Cauchy's Theorem.

      <theorem permid="fdH">
        <title>First Sylow Theorem</title>
        <statement>
          <p permid="FoA">
            Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>p</m> a prime such that <m>p^r</m> divides <m>|G|</m>.
            Then <m>G</m> contains a subgroup of order <m>p^r</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof permid="FvE">
          <p permid="Dzn">
            We induct on the order of <m>G</m> once again.
            If <m>|G| = p</m>, then we are done.
            Now suppose that the order of <m>G</m> is <m>n</m> with <m>n \gt p</m> and that the theorem is true for all groups of order less than <m>n</m>,
            where <m>p</m> divides <m>n</m>.
            We shall apply the class equation once again:
            <me permid="bkZ">
              |G| = |Z(G)| + [G: C(x_1) ] + \cdots + [ G: C(x_k)]
            </me>.
            First suppose that <m>p</m> does not divide <m>[G:C(x_i)]</m> for some <m>i</m>.
            Then <m>p^r \mid |C(x_i)|</m>,
            since <m>p^r</m> divides <m>|G| = |C(x_i)| \cdot [G:C(x_i)]</m>.
            Now we can apply the induction hypothesis to <m>C(x_i)</m>.
          </p>

          <p permid="jGw">
            Hence, we may assume that <m>p</m> divides <m>[G:C(x_i)]</m> for all <m>i</m>.
            Since <m>p</m> divides <m>|G|</m>,
            the class equation says that <m>p</m> must divide <m>|Z(G)|</m>;
            hence, by Cauchy's Theorem,
            <m>Z(G)</m> has an element of order <m>p</m>, say <m>g</m>.
            Let <m>N</m> be the group generated by <m>g</m>.
            Clearly, <m>N</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>Z(G)</m> since <m>Z(G)</m> is abelian;
            therefore, <m>N</m> is normal in <m>G</m> since every element in <m>Z(G)</m> commutes with every element in <m>G</m>.
            Now consider the factor group <m>G/N</m> of order <m>|G|/p</m>.
            By the induction hypothesis,
            <m>G/N</m> contains a subgroup <m>H</m> of order <m>p^{r- 1}</m>.
            The inverse image of <m>H</m> under the canonical homomorphism
            <m>\phi : G \rightarrow G/N</m> is a subgroup of order <m>p^r</m> in <m>G</m>.

            <m>|{\mathcal S}| \equiv 1 \pmod{p}</m>.

        Peter Ludvig Mejdell Sylow
            <idx><h>Sylow, Ludvig</h></idx>
        was born in 1832 in Christiania, Norway
        (now Oslo).
        After attending Christiania University, Sylow taught high school.
        In 1862 he obtained a temporary appointment at Christiania University.
        Even though his appointment was relatively brief,
        he influenced students such as Sophus Lie
            <idx><h>Lie, Sophus</h></idx>
        (1842<ndash/>1899).
        Sylow had a chance at a permanent chair in 1869,
        but failed to obtain the appointment.
        In 1872, he published a 10-page paper presenting the theorems that now bear his name.
        Later Lie and Sylow collaborated on a new edition of Abel's works.
        In 1898, a chair at Christiania University was finally created for Sylow through the efforts of his student and colleague Lie.
        Sylow died in 1918.

          Using the Sylow Theorems,
          we can determine that <m>A_5</m> has subgroups of orders <m>2</m>,
          <m>3</m>, <m>4</m>, and <m>5</m>.
          The Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups of <m>A_5</m> have orders <m>3</m>,
          <m>4</m>,
          and <m>5</m>.
          The Third Sylow Theorem tells us exactly how many Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroups <m>A_5</m> has.
          Since the number of Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups must divide <m>60</m> and also be congruent to <m>1 \pmod{5}</m>,
          there are either one or six Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups in <m>A_5</m>.
          All Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups are conjugate.
          If there were only a single Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup,
          it would be conjugate to itself;
          that is, it would be a normal subgroup of <m>A_5</m>.
          Since <m>A_5</m> has no normal subgroups, this is impossible;
          hence, we have determined that there are exactly six distinct Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups of <m>A_5</m>.

        The Sylow Theorems allow us to prove many useful results about finite groups.
        By using them,
        we can often conclude a great deal about groups of a particular order if certain hypotheses are satisfied.

            The group <m>G</m> also has a Sylow <m>p</m>-subgroup,

          First we will show that every group <m>G</m> of order <m>99</m> is abelian.
          By the Third Sylow Theorem, there are <m>1 + 3k</m> Sylow <m>3</m>-subgroups,

          Since <m>K</m> has order <m>11</m>,
          it must be isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_{11}</m>.
          Therefore, the only possible groups of order <m>99</m> are

          The Third Sylow Theorem tells us that <m>G</m> has only one subgroup of order <m>5</m> and one subgroup of order <m>7</m>.

        Given a finite group,

        proving a group to be simple can be a very difficult task;
        however, the Sylow Theorems are useful tools for proving that a group is not simple.

          Since there is only a single Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroup and all Sylow <m>5</m>-subgroups are conjugate,

    <title>A Project</title>
    <introduction permid="pCM">
      <p permid="hvK">
        The main objective of finite group theory is to classify all possible finite groups up to isomorphism.
        This problem is very difficult even if we try to classify the groups of order less than or equal to <m>60</m>.
        However, we can break the problem down into several intermediate problems.
        This is a challenging project that requires a working knowledge of the group theory you have learned up to this point.
        Even if you do not complete it,
        it will teach you a great deal about finite groups.
        You can use <xref ref="table-sylow-project"/> as a guide.
