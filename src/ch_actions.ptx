  <title>Group Actions</title>

    <p permid="FuR">
      Group actions generalize group multiplication.
      If <m>G</m> is a group and <m>X</m> is an arbitrary set,
      a group action of an element <m>g \in G</m> and <m>x \in X</m> is a product,
      <m>gx</m>, living in <m>X</m>.
      Many problems in algebra are best be attacked via group actions.
      For example,
      the proofs of the Sylow theorems and of Burnside's Counting Theorem are most easily understood when they are formulated in terms of group actions.

      Let <m>X</m> be a set and <m>G</m> be a group.
      A <term>(left) action</term>
          <idx><h>Group</h><h>action</h></idx>
      of <m>G</m> on <m>X</m> is a map
      <m>G \times X \rightarrow X</m> given by <m>(g,x) \mapsto gx</m>, where

      <ol permid="cps">
        <li permid="IwB">
          <p permid="tXx">
            <m>ex = x</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>;

            <m>(g_1 g_2)x = g_1(g_2 x)</m> for all <m>x \in X</m> and all <m>g_1, g_2 \in G</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      Under these considerations <m>X</m> is called a
      <term><m>G</m>-set</term>.
          <idx><h><m>G</m>-set</h></idx>
      Notice that we are not requiring <m>X</m> to be related to <m>G</m> in any way.
      It is true that every group <m>G</m> acts on every set <m>X</m> by the trivial action <m>(g,x) \mapsto x</m>;
      however, group actions are more interesting if the set <m>X</m> is somehow related to the group <m>G</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-actions-gl2" permid="JXt">
      <p permid="rrm">
        Let <m>G = GL_2( {\mathbb R} )</m> and <m>X = {\mathbb R}^2</m>.
        Then <m>G</m> acts on <m>X</m> by left multiplication.
        If <m>v \in {\mathbb R}^2</m> and <m>I</m> is the identity matrix,
        then <m>Iv = v</m>.
        If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <m>2 \times 2</m> invertible matrices,
        then <m>(AB)v = A(Bv)</m> since matrix multiplication is associative.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-actions-d4" permid="qeC">
      <p permid="Xyv">
        Let <m>G = D_4</m> be the symmetry group of a square.
        If <m>X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}</m> is the set of vertices of the square,
        then we can consider <m>D_4</m> to consist of the following permutations:
        <me permid="IDS">
          \{ (1), (13), (24), (1432), (1234), (12)(34), (14)(23), (13)(24) \}
        </me>.
        The elements of <m>D_4</m> act on <m>X</m> as functions.
        The permutation <m>(13)(24)</m> acts on vertex <m>1</m> by sending it to vertex <m>3</m>,
        on vertex <m>2</m> by sending it to vertex <m>4</m>, and so on.
        It is easy to see that the  axioms of a group action are satisfied.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p permid="rFH">
      In general, if <m>X</m> is any set and <m>G</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_X</m>,
      the group of all permutations acting on <m>X</m>,
      then <m>X</m> is a <m>G</m>-set under the group action
      <me permid="oLb">
        (\sigma, x) \mapsto \sigma(x)
      </me>
      for <m>\sigma \in G</m> and <m>x \in X</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-actions-left-mult" permid="WlL">
      <p permid="DFE">
        If we let <m>X = G</m>,
        then every group <m>G</m> acts on itself by the left regular representation;
        that is, <m>(g,x) \mapsto \lambda_g(x) = gx</m>,
        where  <m>\lambda_g</m> is left multiplication:
        <md permid="USk">
          <mrow>e \cdot x = \lambda_e x = ex = x</mrow>
          <mrow>(gh) \cdot x = \lambda_{gh}x = \lambda_g \lambda_h x = \lambda_g(hx) = g \cdot ( h \cdot x)</mrow>
        </md>.
        If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
        then <m>G</m> is an <m>H</m>-set under left multiplication by elements of <m>H</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-actions-conjugation" permid="CsU">
      <p permid="jMN">
        Let <m>G</m> be a group and suppose that <m>X=G</m>.
        If <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
        then <m>G</m> is an <m>H</m>-set under <term>conjugation</term>;
            <idx><h>Conjugation</h></idx>
        that is, we can define an action of <m>H</m> on <m>G</m>,
        <me permid="AZt">
          H \times G \rightarrow G
        </me>,
        via
        <me permid="hgC">
          (h,g) \mapsto hgh^{-1}
        </me>
        for <m>h \in H</m> and <m>g \in G</m>.
        Clearly, the first axiom for a group action holds.
        Observing that
        <md permid="NnL">
          <mrow>(h_1 h_2, g) &amp; = h_1 h_2 g (h_1 h_2 )^{-1}</mrow>

          <mrow>&amp; =  (h_1, (h_2, g) )</mrow>
        </md>,
        we see that the second condition is also satisfied.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-actions-left-cosets" permid="iAd">
      <p permid="PTW">
        Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> and
        <m>{\mathcal L}_H</m> the set of left cosets of <m>H</m>.
        The set <m>{\mathcal L}_H</m> is a <m>G</m>-set under the action
        <me permid="tuU">
          (g, xH) \mapsto gxH
        </me>.
        Again, it is easy to see that the first axiom is true.
        Since <m>(g g')xH = g( g'x H)</m>,
        the second axiom is  also true.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p permid="XMQ">

      We write <m>x \sim_G y</m> or

          Then <m>G</m>-equivalence is an equivalence relation on <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof permid="Qwz">
        <p permid="QZp">
          The relation <m>\sim</m> is reflexive since <m>ex = x</m>.
          Suppose that <m>x \sim y</m> for <m>x, y \in X</m>.
          Then there exists a <m>g</m> such that <m>gx = y</m>.
          In this case <m>g^{-1}y=x</m>;
          hence, <m>y \sim x</m>.
          To show that the relation is transitive,
          suppose that <m>x \sim y</m> and <m>y \sim z</m>.
          Then there must exist group elements <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> such that <m>gx = y</m> and <m>hy= z</m>.
          So <m>z = hy = (hg)x</m>, and <m>x</m> is equivalent to <m>z</m>.

        For <m>S_n</m> it takes a bit of work to find the conjugacy classes.
        We begin with cycles.
        Suppose that <m>\sigma = ( a_1, \ldots,

        Before we apply Burnside's Theorem to switching-theory problems,
        let us examine the number of ways in which the vertices of a square can be colored black or white.
        Notice that we can sometimes obtain equivalent colorings by simply applying a rigid motion to the square.
        For instance, as we have pointed out,
        if we color one of the vertices black and the remaining three white,
        it does not matter which vertex was colored black since a rotation will give an equivalent coloring.
      </p>

      <p permid="Dkf">
        The  symmetry group of a square,
        <m>D_4</m>, is given by the following permutations:
        <md permid="JnM">
          <mrow>&amp;(1)    &amp; &amp;(13)     &amp; &amp; (24)     &amp; &amp; (1432)</mrow>

        </md>
        The group <m>G</m> acts on the set of vertices <m>\{ 1, 2, 3, 4\}</m> in the usual manner.
        We can describe the different colorings by mappings from <m>X</m> into
        <m>Y = \{ B, W \}</m> where <m>B</m> and <m>W</m> represent the colors black and white,
        respectively.
        Each map <m>f : X \rightarrow Y</m> describes a way to color the corners of the square.
        Every <m>\sigma \in D_4</m> induces a permutation
        <m>\widetilde{ \sigma }</m> of the possible colorings given by
        <m>\widetilde{\sigma}(f) = f \circ \sigma</m> for <m>f : X \rightarrow Y</m>.
        For example, suppose that <m>f</m> is defined by
        <md permid="puV">
          <mrow>f(1) &amp; =  B</mrow>
          <mrow>f(2) &amp; =  W</mrow>

          <mrow>f(4) &amp; =  W</mrow>
        </md>
        and <m>\sigma = (1 2)(3 4)</m>.
        Then <m>\widetilde{\sigma}(f) = f \circ \sigma</m> sends vertex <m>2</m> to <m>B</m> and the remaining vertices to <m>W</m>.
        The set of all such <m>\widetilde{\sigma}</m> is a permutation group
        <m>\widetilde{G}</m> on the set of possible colorings.
        Let <m>\widetilde{X}</m> denote the set of all possible colorings;
        that is, <m>\widetilde{X}</m> is the set of all possible maps from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m>.

            The map <m>\sigma \mapsto \widetilde{\sigma}</m> is onto,

      <p permid="sLa">
        William Burnside
            <idx><h>Burnside, William</h></idx>
        was born in London in 1852.
        He attended Cambridge University from 1871 to 1875 and won the Smith's Prize in his last year.
        After his graduation he lectured at Cambridge.
        He was made a member of the Royal Society in 1893.
        Burnside wrote approximately 150 papers on topics in applied mathematics,
        differential geometry, and probability,
        but his most famous contributions were in group theory.
        Several of Burnside's conjectures have stimulated research to this day.
        One such conjecture was that every group of odd order is solvable;
        that is, for a group <m>G</m> of odd order,
        there exists a sequence of subgroups
        <me permid="mAp">
          G = H_n \supset H_{n-1} \supset \cdots \supset H_1 \supset H_0 = \{ e \}
        </me>
        such that <m>H_i</m> is normal in <m>H_{i+1}</m> and <m>H_{i+1} / H_i</m> is abelian.
        This conjecture was finally proven by W. Feit
            <idx><h>Feit, W.</h></idx>
        and J. Thompson
            <idx><h>Thompson, J.</h></idx>
        in 1963.
        Burnside's <pubtitle>The Theory of Groups of Finite Order</pubtitle>,
        published in 1897,
        was one of the first books to treat groups in a modern context as opposed to permutation groups.
        The second edition, published in 1911, is still a classic.
