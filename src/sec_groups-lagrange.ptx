            Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> with <m>g \in G</m> and define a map
            <m>\phi:H \rightarrow gH</m> by <m>\phi(h) = gh</m>.
            The map <m>\phi</m> is bijective;

          <p permid="ANY">
            We first show that the map <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one.
            Suppose that <m>\phi(h_1) = \phi(h_2)</m> for elements <m>h_1, h_2 \in H</m>.
            We must show that <m>h_1 = h_2</m>,
            but <m>\phi(h_1) = gh_1</m> and <m>\phi(h_2) = gh_2</m>.
            So <m>gh_1 = gh_2</m>, and by left cancellation <m>h_1= h_2</m>.
            To show that <m>\phi</m> is onto is easy.
            By definition every element of <m>gH</m> is of the form <m>gh</m> for some <m>h \in H</m> and <m>\phi(h) = gh</m>.

          Joseph-Louis Lagrange
              <idx><h>Lagrange, Joseph-Louis</h></idx>
          (1736<ndash/>1813), born in Turin, Italy,
          was of French and Italian descent.
          His talent for mathematics became apparent at an early age.
          Leonhard Euler
              <idx><h>Euler, Leonhard</h></idx>
          recognized Lagrange's abilities when Lagrange, who was only 19,
          communicated to Euler some work that he had done in the calculus of variations.
          That year he was also named a professor at the Royal Artillery School in Turin.
          At the age of 23 he joined the Berlin Academy.
          Frederick the Great had written to Lagrange proclaiming that the
          <q>greatest king in Europe</q>
          should have the <q>greatest mathematician in Europe</q> at his court.
          For 20 years Lagrange held the position vacated by his mentor, Euler.
          His works include contributions to number theory,
          group theory, physics and mechanics,
          the calculus of variations,
          the theory of equations, and differential equations.
          Along with Laplace and Lavoisier, Lagrange was one of the people responsible for designing the metric system.
          During his life Lagrange profoundly influenced the development of mathematics,
          leaving much to the next generation of mathematicians in the form of examples and new problems to be solved.
