        Given an element <m>a</m> in a group <m>G</m>, we can consider what happens when we multiply <m>a</m> by itself (or if we are writing the group additively, add <m>a</m> to itself).  Depending on what group we are in, if we continue to multiply the result by <m>a</m>, we might eventually find ourselves back at the identity.  How long does this take?  That is precisely the question that the <em>order</em> of a group element addresses.  We will see that this relatively simple idea has far reaching consequences.

          Often a subgroup will depend entirely on a single element of the group;
          that is, knowing that particular element will allow us to compute any other element in the subgroup.

            Suppose that we consider <m>3 \in {\mathbb Z}</m> and look at all multiples

            As a set, this is

            It is easy to see that <m>3 {\mathbb Z}</m> is a subgroup of the integers.
            This subgroup is completely determined by the element <m>3</m> since we can obtain all of the other elements of the group by taking multiples of <m>3</m>.
            Every element in the subgroup is

              Clearly, any subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> containing <m>a</m> must contain all the powers of <m>a</m> by closure;

            <p permid="FsB">
              The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the Principle of Well-Ordering.
              Let <m>G</m> be a cyclic group generated by <m>a</m> and suppose that <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
              If <m>H = \{ e \}</m>, then trivially <m>H</m> is cyclic.
              Suppose that <m>H</m> contains some other element <m>g</m> distinct from the identity.
              Then <m>g</m> can be written as <m>a^n</m> for some integer <m>n</m>.
              Since <m>H</m> is a subgroup,
              <m>g^{-1} = a^{-n}</m> must also be in <m>H</m>.
              Since either <m>n</m> or <m>-n</m> is positive,
              we can assume that <m>H</m> contains positive powers of <m>a</m> and <m>n \gt 0</m>.
              Let <m>m</m> be the smallest natural number such that <m>a^m \in H</m>.
              Such an <m>m</m> exists by the Principle of Well-Ordering.

            <p permid="lzK">
              We claim that <m>h = a^m</m> is a generator for <m>H</m>.
              We must show that every <m>h' \in H</m> can be written as a power of <m>h</m>.
              Since <m>h' \in H</m> and <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
              <m>h' = a^k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
              Using the division algorithm,
              we can find numbers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
              <m>k = mq +r</m> where <m>0 \leq r \lt m</m>; hence,

              So <m>a^r = a^k h^{-q}</m>.
              Since <m>a^k</m> and <m>h^{-q}</m> are in <m>H</m>,
              <m>a^r</m> must also be in <m>H</m>.
              However, <m>m</m> was the smallest positive number such that <m>a^m</m> was in <m>H</m>;
              consequently, <m>r=0</m> and so <m>k=mq</m>.

            and <m>15</m> are the elements of
            <m>{\mathbb Z}_{16}</m> that are relatively prime to <m>16</m>.
            Each of these elements generates <m>{\mathbb Z}_{16}</m>.
            For example,
            <md permid="ZVm">
              <mrow>1 \cdot 9  &amp; =  9  &amp;  2 \cdot 9  &amp; = 2  &amp; 3 \cdot 9  &amp; = 11</mrow>
