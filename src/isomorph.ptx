      Many groups may appear to be different at first glance,
      but can be shown to be the same by a simple renaming of the group elements.
      For example,
      <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m> and the subgroup of the circle group
      <m>{\mathbb T}</m> generated by <m>i</m> can be shown to be the same by demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two groups and between the group operations.
      In such a case we say that the groups are isomorphic.

          To show that <m>{\mathbb Z}_4 \cong \langle i \rangle</m>,
          define a map <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z}_4 \rightarrow \langle i \rangle</m> by <m>\phi(n) = i^n</m>.
          We must show that <m>\phi</m> is bijective and preserves the group operation.
          The map <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one and onto because

          the group operation is preserved.

          We can define an isomorphism <m>\phi</m> from the additive group of real numbers
          <m>( {\mathbb R}, + )</m> to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers

          Of course, we must still show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one and onto,
          but this can be determined using calculus.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-isomorph-rational" permid="svs">
        <p permid="cos">
          The integers are isomorphic to the subgroup of
          <m>{\mathbb Q}^\ast</m> consisting of elements of the form <m>2^n</m>.
          Define a map <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow {\mathbb Q}^\ast</m> by <m>\phi( n ) = 2^n</m>.
          Then
          <me permid="QYp">

          By definition the map <m>\phi</m> is onto the subset
          <m>\{2^n :n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m> of  <m>{\mathbb Q}^\ast</m>.
          To show that the map is injective,
          assume that <m>m \neq n</m>.
          If we can show that <m>\phi(m) \neq \phi(n)</m>, then we are done.
          Suppose that <m>m \gt n</m> and assume that <m>\phi(m) = \phi(n)</m>.
          Then <m>2^m = 2^n</m> or <m>2^{m - n} = 1</m>,
          which is impossible since <m>m - n \gt 0</m>.

          The groups <m>{\mathbb Z}_8</m> and
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m> cannot be isomorphic since they have different orders;
          however, it is true that <m>U(8) \cong U(12)</m>.
          We know that

          </md>.
          An isomorphism <m>\phi : U(8) \rightarrow U(12)</m> is then given by
          <md permid="dmH">

            <mrow>7 &amp; \mapsto  11</mrow>
          </md>.
          The map <m>\phi</m> is not the only possible isomorphism between these two groups.
          We could define another isomorphism <m>\psi</m> by <m>\psi(1) = 1</m>,
          <m>\psi(3) = 11</m>, <m>\psi(5) = 5</m>, <m>\psi(7) = 7</m>.
          In fact, both of these groups are isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2</m>
          (see <xref ref="example-groups-z2xz2"/> in <xref ref="groups"/>).

          Even though <m>S_3</m> and

          we would suspect that they are not isomorphic,
          because <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> is abelian and <m>S_3</m> is nonabelian.
          To demonstrate that this is indeed the case,
          suppose that <m>\phi : {\mathbb Z}_6 \rightarrow  S_3</m> is an isomorphism.
          Let <m>a , b \in S_3</m> be two elements such that <m>ab \neq ba</m>.
          Since <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism,

            To show that <m>\lambda_g</m> is onto,

        Arthur Cayley
            <idx><h>Cayley, Arthur</h></idx>
        was born in England in 1821,
        though he spent much of the first part of his life in Russia,
        where his father was a merchant.
        Cayley was educated at Cambridge,
        where he took the first Smith's Prize in mathematics.
        A lawyer for much of his adult life,
        he wrote several papers in his early twenties before entering the legal profession at the age of 25.
        While practicing law he continued his mathematical research,
        writing more than 300 papers during this period of his life.
        These included some of his best work.
        In 1863 he left law to become a professor at Cambridge.
        Cayley wrote more than 900 papers in fields such as group theory,
        geometry, and linear algebra.
        His legal knowledge was very valuable to Cambridge;
        he participated in the writing of many of the university's statutes.
        Cayley was also one of the people responsible for the admission of women to Cambridge.

          Clearly, <m>\eta</m> is onto <m>\psi( G)</m>.

        Let <m>G</m> be a cyclic group with generator <m>g</m>.
        Define a map <m>\phi : {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow G</m> by <m>n \mapsto g^n</m>.
        This map is a surjective homomorphism since
    <me permid="ApM">
          \phi( m + n) = g^{m+n} = g^m g^n = \phi(m) \phi(n)

        Clearly <m>\phi</m> is onto.
        If <m>|g| = m</m>, then  <m>g^m = e</m>.
        Hence, <m>\ker \phi = m {\mathbb Z}</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z} / \ker \phi =  {\mathbb Z} / m {\mathbb Z} \cong G</m>.
        On the other hand, if the order of <m>g</m> is infinite,
        then <m>\ker \phi = 0</m> and <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism of <m>G</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.
        Hence, two cyclic groups are isomorphic exactly when they have the same order.
        Up to isomorphism, the only cyclic groups are
    <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.

          We will first show that <m>HN = \{ hn : h \in H, n \in N \}</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.

            The possible kernels are the subgroups of <m>\Z_{24}</m>.  We could have <m>K = \Z_{24}</m>, and this gives the trivial homomorphism (everything goes to 0).  Our next possible kernel is <m>\langle 2 \rangle = \{0, 2, 4, \ldots, 22\}</m>.  We can then send everything else to <m>9 \in \Z_{18}</m>.

The next possible subgroup the kernel could be is <m>\langle 6 \rangle = \{0, 6, 12, 18\}</m>, which would give us 6 cosets.  There is a subgroup of order 6 in <m>\Z_{18}</m>, namely <m>\langle 3 \rangle = \{0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\}</m>.  So we can define <m>\phi(n) = 3n</m> as the homomorphism.
