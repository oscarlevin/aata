      <title>Field Automorphisms</title>

        <p permid="sqb">
          Our first task is to establish a link between group theory and field theory by examining automorphisms of fields.

              The set of all automorphisms of a field <m>F</m> is a group under composition of functions.

          <proof permid="ISA">
            <p permid="vGg">
              If <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are automorphisms of <m>F</m>,
              then so are <m>\sigma \tau</m> and <m>\sigma^{-1}</m>.
              The identity is certainly an automorphism;
              hence, the set of all automorphisms of a field <m>F</m> is indeed a group.

            <p permid="bNp">
              We need only show that the set of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>F</m> elementwise is a subgroup of the group of all automorphisms of <m>E</m>.
              Let <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> be two automorphisms of <m>E</m> such that <m>\sigma( \alpha ) = \alpha</m> and

              Then <m>\sigma \tau( \alpha ) = \sigma( \alpha) = \alpha</m> and <m>\sigma^{-1}( \alpha ) = \alpha</m>.
              Since the identity fixes every element of <m>E</m>,
              the set of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that leave elements of <m>F</m> fixed is a subgroup of the entire group of automorphisms of <m>E</m>.

            We can now confirm that the Galois group of <m>{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )</m> over
            <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> in <xref ref="example-galois-q-sqrt5"/> is indeed isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
            Certainly the group <m>H = \{ \identity, \sigma, \tau, \mu \}</m> is a subgroup of <m>G({\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )/{\mathbb Q})</m>;
            however, <m>H</m> must be all of <m>G({\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )/{\mathbb Q})</m>, since
            <me permid="RRa">
              |H| = [{\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, ):{\mathbb Q}] = |G({\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\, )/{\mathbb Q})| = 4

            Let us compute the Galois group of
            <me permid="xYj">
              f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1
            </me>
            over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
            First let's check that <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>\Q</m>.  To do this, consider a new polynomial <m>g(x) = f(x+1)</m> (essentially doing a change of variables).  We have 
            <me>
              g(x) = x^4 + 5x^3 + 10x^2 + 10x + 5.
            </me>
            This is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion.  But if <m>f(x)</m> factored, then so would <m>g(x)</m>, so we see that <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, since <m>(x -1)f(x) = x^5 - 1</m>,
            we can use DeMoivre's Theorem to determine that the roots of <m>f(x)</m> are <m>\omega^i</m>,
            where  <m>i = 1, \ldots, 4</m> and
            <me permid="efs">
              \omega = \cos(2 \pi / 5 ) + i \sin(2 \pi / 5 )
            </me>.
            Hence, the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> must be <m>{\mathbb Q}(\omega)</m>.
            We can define automorphisms
            <m>\sigma_i</m> of <m>{\mathbb Q}(\omega )</m> by
            <m>\sigma_i( \omega ) = \omega^i</m> for <m>i = 1, \ldots, 4</m>.
            It is easy to check that these are indeed distinct automorphisms in <m>G( {\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q} )</m>.
            Since
            <me permid="KmB">
              [{\mathbb Q}( \omega) : {\mathbb Q}] = | G( {\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q})| = 4
            </me>,
            the <m>\sigma_i</m>'s must be all of <m>G( {\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q} )</m>.
            Therefore, <m>G({\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q})\cong {\mathbb Z}_4</m> since <m>\omega</m> is a generator for the Galois group.
